Abdelfattah	Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context windows enable powerful applications but come at the cost of high memory consumption to store the Key and Value states (KV-Cache). Recent studies attempted to merge KV-cache from multiple layers into shared representations, yet these approaches either require expensive pretraining or rely on assumptions of high per-token cosine similarity across layers which generally does not hold in practice. We find that the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple layers of the KV-Cache. Exploiting this insight, we propose xKV, a simple post-training method that applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the KV-Cache of grouped layers. xKV consolidates the KV-Cache of multiple layers into a shared low-rank subspace, significantly reducing KV-Cache sizes. Through extensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates than state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%. Moreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding tasks without performance degradation. These results highlight xKV's strong capability and versatility in addressing memory bottlenecks for long-context LLM inference. Our code is publicly available at: this https URL.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18891	AgentDropout: Dynamic Agent Elimination for Token-Efficient and High-Performance LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration	Zhexuan Wang, Yutong Wang, Xuebo Liu, Liang Ding, Miao Zhang, Jie Liu, Min Zhang	Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in collaborative problem-solving. However, they still face substantial challenges of low communication efficiency and suboptimal task performance, making the careful design of the agents' communication topologies particularly important. Inspired by the management theory that roles in an efficient team are often dynamically adjusted, we propose AgentDropout, which identifies redundant agents and communication across different communication rounds by optimizing the adjacency matrices of the communication graphs and eliminates them to enhance both token efficiency and task performance. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, AgentDropout achieves an average reduction of 21.6% in prompt token consumption and 18.4% in completion token consumption, along with a performance improvement of 1.14 on the tasks. Furthermore, the extended experiments demonstrate that AgentDropout achieves notable domain transferability and structure robustness, revealing its reliability and effectiveness. We release our code at this https URL.	Computation and Language (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18878	I Have Covered All the Bases Here: Interpreting Reasoning Features in Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders	Andrey Galichin, Alexey Dontsov, Polina Druzhinina, Anton Razzhigaev, Oleg Y. Rogov, Elena Tutubalina, Ivan Oseledets	Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing. Recent advances have led to the developing of a new class of reasoning LLMs; for example, open-source DeepSeek-R1 has achieved state-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex reasoning. Despite these impressive capabilities, the internal reasoning mechanisms of such models remain unexplored. In this work, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), a method to learn a sparse decomposition of latent representations of a neural network into interpretable features, to identify features that drive reasoning in the DeepSeek-R1 series of models. First, we propose an approach to extract candidate ''reasoning features'' from SAE representations. We validate these features through empirical analysis and interpretability methods, demonstrating their direct correlation with the model's reasoning abilities. Crucially, we demonstrate that steering these features systematically enhances reasoning performance, offering the first mechanistic account of reasoning in LLMs. Code available at this https URL	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18769	AlphaSpace: Enabling Robotic Actions through Semantic Tokenization and Symbolic Reasoning	Alan Dao (Gia Tuan Dao), Dinh Bach Vu, Bui Quang Huy	This paper presents AlphaSpace, a novel methodology designed to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for 3D Cartesian space navigation. AlphaSpace employs a semantics-based tokenization strategy, encoding height information through specialized semantic tokens, and integrates primarily symbolic synthetic reasoning data. This approach enables LLMs to accurately manipulate objects by positioning them at specific [x, y, z] coordinates. Experimental results demonstrate that AlphaSpace significantly outperforms existing models on manipulation subtasks, achieving a total accuracy of 66.67%, compared to 37.5% for GPT-4o and 29.17% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18760	Synthetic Function Demonstrations Improve Generation in Low-Resource Programming Languages	Nick McKenna, Xinnuo Xu, Jack Williams, Nick Wilson, Benjamin Van Durme, Christian Poelitz	A key consideration when training an LLM is whether the target language is more or less resourced, whether this is English compared to Welsh, or Python compared to Excel. Typical training data for programming languages consist of real program demonstrations coupled with human-written comments. Here we present novel approaches to the creation of such data for low resource programming languages. We generate fully-synthetic, textbook-quality demonstrations of common library functions in an example domain of Excel formulas, using a teacher model. We then finetune an underperforming student model, and show improvement on 2 question-answering datasets recast into the Excel domain. We show advantages of finetuning over standard, off-the-shelf RAG approaches, which can offer only modest improvement due to the unfamiliar target domain.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18751	Construction Identification and Disambiguation Using BERT: A Case Study of NPN	Wesley Scivetti, Nathan Schneider	Construction Grammar hypothesizes that knowledge of a language consists chiefly of knowledge of form-meaning pairs (''constructions'') that include vocabulary, general grammar rules, and even idiosyncratic patterns. Recent work has shown that transformer language models represent at least some constructional patterns, including ones where the construction is rare overall. In this work, we probe BERT's representation of the form and meaning of a minor construction of English, the NPN (noun-preposition-noun) construction -- exhibited in such expressions as face to face and day to day -- which is known to be polysemous. We construct a benchmark dataset of semantically annotated corpus instances (including distractors that superficially resemble the construction). With this dataset, we train and evaluate probing classifiers. They achieve decent discrimination of the construction from distractors, as well as sense disambiguation among true instances of the construction, revealing that BERT embeddings carry indications of the construction's semantics. Moreover, artificially permuting the word order of true construction instances causes them to be rejected, indicating sensitivity to matters of form. We conclude that BERT does latently encode at least some knowledge of the NPN construction going beyond a surface syntactic pattern and lexical cues.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18730	Predicting the Road Ahead: A Knowledge Graph based Foundation Model for Scene Understanding in Autonomous Driving	Hongkuan Zhou, Stefan Schmid, Yicong Li, Lavdim Halilaj, Xiangtong Yao, Wei cao	The autonomous driving field has seen remarkable advancements in various topics, such as object recognition, trajectory prediction, and motion planning. However, current approaches face limitations in effectively comprehending the complex evolutions of driving scenes over time. This paper proposes FM4SU, a novel methodology for training a symbolic foundation model (FM) for scene understanding in autonomous driving. It leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture sensory observation along with domain knowledge such as road topology, traffic rules, or complex interactions between traffic participants. A bird's eye view (BEV) symbolic representation is extracted from the KG for each driving scene, including the spatio-temporal information among the objects across the scenes. The BEV representation is serialized into a sequence of tokens and given to pre-trained language models (PLMs) for learning an inherent understanding of the co-occurrence among driving scene elements and generating predictions on the next scenes. We conducted a number of experiments using the nuScenes dataset and KG in various scenarios. The results demonstrate that fine-tuned models achieve significantly higher accuracy in all tasks. The fine-tuned T5 model achieved a next scene prediction accuracy of 86.7%. This paper concludes that FM4SU offers a promising foundation for developing more comprehensive models for scene understanding in autonomous driving.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18702	Unsupervised Acquisition of Discrete Grammatical Categories	David Ph. Shakouri, Crit Cremers, Niels O. Schiller	This article presents experiments performed using a computational laboratory environment for language acquisition experiments. It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18681	Commander-GPT: Fully Unleashing the Sarcasm Detection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models	Yazhou Zhang, Chunwang Zou, Bo Wang, Jing Qin	Sarcasm detection, as a crucial research direction in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), has attracted widespread attention. Traditional sarcasm detection tasks have typically focused on single-modal approaches (e.g., text), but due to the implicit and subtle nature of sarcasm, such methods often fail to yield satisfactory results. In recent years, researchers have shifted the focus of sarcasm detection to multi-modal approaches. However, effectively leveraging multi-modal information to accurately identify sarcastic content remains a challenge that warrants further exploration. Leveraging the powerful integrated processing capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for various information sources, we propose an innovative multi-modal Commander-GPT framework. Inspired by military strategy, we first decompose the sarcasm detection task into six distinct sub-tasks. A central commander (decision-maker) then assigns the best-suited large language model to address each specific sub-task. Ultimately, the detection results from each model are aggregated to identify sarcasm. We conducted extensive experiments on MMSD and MMSD 2.0, utilizing four multi-modal large language models and six prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 19.3% improvement in F1 score, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18646	ZeroLM: Data-Free Transformer Architecture Search for Language Models	Zhen-Song Chen, Hong-Wei Ding, Xian-Jia Wang, Witold Pedrycz	Neural architecture search (NAS) provides a systematic framework for automating the design of neural network architectures, yet its widespread adoption is hindered by prohibitive computational requirements. Existing zero-cost proxy methods, while reducing search overhead, demonstrate inadequate performance in architecture ranking tasks, particularly for Transformer-based models where they often underperform simple parameter counting metrics. Current automated proxy discovery approaches suffer from extended search times, susceptibility to data overfitting, and structural complexity. This paper introduces a novel zero-cost proxy methodology that quantifies model capacity through efficient weight statistics computation while decomposing Transformer architectures into functionally distinct sub-modules, thereby optimizing the balance of their contributions to overall performance. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of this approach, achieving a Spearman's rho of 0.76 and Kendall's tau of 0.53 on the FlexiBERT benchmark. The proposed method exhibits exceptional computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance across diverse NAS benchmark tasks, offering a practical solution for large-scale architecture search.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18603	LANGALIGN: Enhancing Non-English Language Models via Cross-Lingual Embedding Alignment	Jong Myoung Kim, Young-Jun Lee, Ho-Jin Choi, Sangkeun Jung	While Large Language Models have gained attention, many service developers still rely on embedding-based models due to practical constraints. In such cases, the quality of fine-tuning data directly impacts performance, and English datasets are often used as seed data for training non-English models. In this study, we propose LANGALIGN, which enhances target language processing by aligning English embedding vectors with those of the target language at the interface between the language model and the task header. Experiments on Korean, Japanese, and Chinese demonstrate that LANGALIGN significantly improves performance across all three languages. Additionally, we show that LANGALIGN can be applied in reverse to convert target language data into a format that an English-based model can process.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18596	LinkAlign: Scalable Schema Linking for Real-World Large-Scale Multi-Database Text-to-SQL	Yihan Wang, Peiyu Liu, Xin Yang	Schema linking is a critical bottleneck in achieving human-level performance in Text-to-SQL tasks, particularly in real-world large-scale multi-database scenarios. Addressing schema linking faces two major challenges: (1) Database Retrieval: selecting the correct database from a large schema pool in multi-database settings, while filtering out irrelevant ones. (2) Schema Item Grounding: accurately identifying the relevant tables and columns from within a large and redundant schema for SQL generation. To address this, we introduce LinkAlign, a novel framework that can effectively adapt existing baselines to real-world environments by systematically addressing schema linking. Our framework comprises three key steps: multi-round semantic enhanced retrieval and irrelevant information isolation for Challenge 1, and schema extraction enhancement for Challenge 2. We evaluate our method performance of schema linking on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks, and the ability to adapt existing Text-to-SQL models to real-world environments on the SPIDER 2.0-lite benchmark. Experiments show that LinkAlign outperforms existing baselines in multi-database settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. On the other hand, our method ranks highest among models excluding those using long chain-of-thought reasoning LLMs. This work bridges the gap between current research and real-world scenarios, providing a practical solution for robust and scalable schema linking.

Objective: The study aims to perform a systematic review to comprehensively assess and analyze the state-of-the-art NLP methods for the mainland Scandinavian clinical text. Method: A literature search was conducted in various online databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, ACM digital library, and IEEE Xplore between December 2022 and February 2024. Further, relevant references to the included articles were also used to solidify our search. The final pool includes articles that conducted clinical NLP in the mainland Scandinavian languages and were published in English between 2010 and 2024. Results: Out of the 113 articles, 18% (n=21) focus on Norwegian clinical text, 64% (n=72) on Swedish, 10% (n=11) on Danish, and 8% (n=9) focus on more than one language. Generally, the review identified positive developments across the region despite some observable gaps and disparities between the languages. There are substantial disparities in the level of adoption of transformer-based models. In essential tasks such as de-identification, there is significantly less research activity focusing on Norwegian and Danish compared to Swedish text. Further, the review identified a low level of sharing resources such as data, experimentation code, pre-trained models, and rate of adaptation and transfer learning in the region. Conclusion: The review presented a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art Clinical NLP for electronic health records (EHR) text in mainland Scandinavian languages and, highlighted the potential barriers and challenges that hinder the rapid advancement of the field in the region.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18526	SciClaims: An End-to-End Generative System for Biomedical Claim Analysis	RaÃºl Ortega, JosÃ© Manuel GÃ³mez-PÃ©rez	Validating key claims in scientific literature, particularly in biomedical research, is essential for ensuring accuracy and advancing knowledge. This process is critical in sectors like the pharmaceutical industry, where rapid scientific progress requires automation and deep domain expertise. However, current solutions have significant limitations. They lack end-to-end pipelines encompassing all claim extraction, evidence retrieval, and verification steps; rely on complex NLP and information retrieval pipelines prone to multiple failure points; and often fail to provide clear, user-friendly justifications for claim verification outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce SciClaims, an advanced system powered by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) that seamlessly integrates the entire scientific claim analysis process. SciClaims outperforms previous approaches in both claim extraction and verification without requiring additional fine-tuning, setting a new benchmark for automated scientific claim analysis.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18502	Autoregressive Language Models for Knowledge Base Population: A case study in the space mission domain	AndrÃ©s GarcÃ­a-Silva, JosÃ© Manuel GÃ³mez-PÃ©rez	Knowledge base population KBP plays a crucial role in populating and maintaining knowledge bases up-to-date in organizations by leveraging domain corpora. Motivated by the increasingly large context windows supported by large language models, we propose to fine-tune an autoregressive language model for end-toend KPB. Our case study involves the population of a space mission knowledge graph. To fine-tune the model we generate a dataset for end-to-end KBP tapping into existing domain resources. Our case study shows that fine-tuned language models of limited size can achieve competitive and even higher accuracy than larger models in the KBP task. Smaller models specialized for KBP offer affordable deployment and lower-cost inference. Moreover, KBP specialist models do not require the ontology to be included in the prompt, allowing for more space in the context for additional input text or output serialization.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18491	MAGIC-VQA: Multimodal And Grounded Inference with Commonsense Knowledge for Visual Question Answering	Shuo Yang, Siwen Luo, Soyeon Caren Han, Eduard Hovy	Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires reasoning across visual and textual modalities, yet Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often lack integrated commonsense knowledge, limiting their robustness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we introduce MAGIC-VQA, a novel framework that enhances VQA by systematically integrating commonsense knowledge with LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA employs a three-stage process: (1) Explicit Knowledge Integration from external sources, (2) By-Type Post-Processing for contextual refinement, and (3) Implicit Knowledge Augmentation using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for structured reasoning. While GNNs bring greater depth to structured inference, they enable superior relational inference beyond LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA bridges a key gap by unifying commonsensse knowledge with LVLM-driven reasoning, eliminating the need for extensive pre-training or complex prompt tuning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, significantly improving commonsense reasoning in VQA.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025

While the foundational Whisper model struggles with Amharic due to limited representation in its training data, we fine-tune it using datasets like Mozilla Common Voice, FLEURS, and the BDU-speech dataset. The best-performing model, Whispersmall-am, significantly improves when finetuned on a mix of existing FLEURS data and new, unseen Amharic datasets. Training solely on new data leads to poor performance, but combining it with FLEURS data reinforces the model, enabling better specialization in Amharic. We also demonstrate that normalizing Amharic homophones significantly enhances Word Error Rate (WER) and Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) scores. This study underscores the importance of fine-tuning strategies and dataset composition for improving ASR in low-resource languages, providing insights for future Amharic speech recognition research.

This exploration process is frequently hampered by field-specific jargon. Past computational work often focuses on supporting translation work by removing jargon through simplification and summarization; here, we explore a different approach that preserves jargon as useful bridges to new conceptual spaces. Specifically, we cast different scholarly domains as different language-using communities, and explore how to adapt techniques from unsupervised cross-lingual alignment of word embeddings to explore conceptual alignments between domain-specific word embedding this http URL developed a prototype cross-domain search engine that uses aligned domain-specific embeddings to support conceptual exploration, and tested this prototype in two case studies. We discuss qualitative insights into the promises and pitfalls of this approach to translation work, and suggest design insights for future interfaces that provide computational support for cross-domain information seeking.

Most existing studies focus on judging the final answer at the problem level, while they ignore detailed feedback on each step in a math problem-solving process, which requires abilities of semantic understanding and reasoning. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method to boost large language model (LLM) for step-level automatic math correction, named StepAMC. Particularly, we convert the step-level automatic math correction within the text classification task into an RL problem to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Then, we design a space-constrained policy network to improve the stability of RL. Then, we introduce a fine-grained reward network to convert the binary human feedback into a continuous value. We conduct extensive experiments over two benchmark datasets and the results show that our model outperforms the eleven strong baselines.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18360	J&H: Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Models Under Knowledge-Injection Attacks in Legal Domain	Yiran Hu, Huanghai Liu, Qingjing Chen, Ning Zheng, Chong Wang, Yun Liu, Charles L.A. Clarke, Weixing Shen	As the scale and capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) increase, their applications in knowledge-intensive fields such as legal domain have garnered widespread attention. However, it remains doubtful whether these LLMs make judgments based on domain knowledge for reasoning. If LLMs base their judgments solely on specific words or patterns, rather than on the underlying logic of the language, the ''LLM-as-judges'' paradigm poses substantial risks in the real-world applications. To address this question, we propose a method of legal knowledge injection attacks for robustness testing, thereby inferring whether LLMs have learned legal knowledge and reasoning logic. In this paper, we propose J&H: an evaluation framework for detecting the robustness of LLMs under knowledge injection attacks in the legal domain. The aim of the framework is to explore whether LLMs perform deductive reasoning when accomplishing legal tasks. To further this aim, we have attacked each part of the reasoning logic underlying these tasks (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion generation). We have collected mistakes that legal experts might make in judicial decisions in the real world, such as typos, legal synonyms, inaccurate external legal statutes retrieval. However, in real legal practice, legal experts tend to overlook these mistakes and make judgments based on logic. However, when faced with these errors, LLMs are likely to be misled by typographical errors and may not utilize logic in their judgments. We conducted knowledge injection attacks on existing general and domain-specific LLMs. Current LLMs are not robust against the attacks employed in our experiments. In addition we propose and compare several methods to enhance the knowledge robustness of LLMs.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18296	Surgical Action Planning with Large Language Models	Mengya Xu, Zhongzhen Huang, Jie Zhang, Xiaofan Zhang, Qi Dou	In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, we introduce the Surgical Action Planning (SAP) task, which generates future action plans from visual inputs to address the absence of intraoperative predictive planning in current intelligent applications. SAP shows great potential for enhancing intraoperative guidance and automating procedures. However, it faces challenges such as understanding instrument-action relationships and tracking surgical progress. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in understanding surgical video content but remain underexplored for predictive decision-making in SAP, as they focus mainly on retrospective analysis. Challenges like data privacy, computational demands, and modality-specific constraints further highlight significant research gaps. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLM-SAP, a Large Language Models-based Surgical Action Planning framework that predicts future actions and generates text responses by interpreting natural language prompts of surgical goals. The text responses potentially support surgical education, intraoperative decision-making, procedure documentation, and skill analysis. LLM-SAP integrates two novel modules: the Near-History Focus Memory Module (NHF-MM) for modeling historical states and the prompts factory for action planning. We evaluate LLM-SAP on our constructed CholecT50-SAP dataset using models like Qwen2.5 and Qwen2-VL, demonstrating its effectiveness in next-action prediction. Pre-trained LLMs are tested zero-shot, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with LoRA is implemented to address data privacy concerns. Our experiments show that Qwen2.5-72B-SFT surpasses Qwen2.5-72B with a 19.3% higher accuracy.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18293	Fact-checking AI-generated news reports: Can LLMs catch their own lies?	Jiayi Yao, Haibo Sun, Nianwen Xue	In this paper, we evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess the veracity of claims in ''news reports'' generated by themselves or other LLMs. Our goal is to determine whether LLMs can effectively fact-check their own content, using methods similar to those used to verify claims made by humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs are more effective at assessing claims in national or international news stories than in local news stories, better at evaluating static information than dynamic information, and better at verifying true claims compared to false ones. We hypothesize that this disparity arises because the former types of claims are better represented in the training data. Additionally, we find that incorporating retrieved results from a search engine in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setting significantly reduces the number of claims an LLM cannot assess. However, this approach also increases the occurrence of incorrect assessments, partly due to irrelevant or low-quality search results. This diagnostic study highlights the need for future research on fact-checking machine-generated reports to prioritize improving the precision and relevance of retrieved information to better support fact-checking efforts. Furthermore, claims about dynamic events and local news may require human-in-the-loop fact-checking systems to ensure accuracy and reliability.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18290	When is dataset cartography ineffective? Using training dynamics does not improve robustness against Adversarial SQuAD	Paul K. Mandal	In this paper, I investigate the effectiveness of dataset cartography for extractive question answering on the SQuAD dataset. I begin by analyzing annotation artifacts in SQuAD and evaluate the impact of two adversarial datasets, AddSent and AddOneSent, on an ELECTRA-small model. Using training dynamics, I partition SQuAD into easy-to-learn, ambiguous, and hard-to-learn subsets. I then compare the performance of models trained on these subsets to those trained on randomly selected samples of equal size. Results show that training on cartography-based subsets does not improve generalization to the SQuAD validation set or the AddSent adversarial set. While the hard-to-learn subset yields a slightly higher F1 score on the AddOneSent dataset, the overall gains are limited. These findings suggest that dataset cartography provides little benefit for adversarial robustness in SQuAD-style QA tasks. I conclude by comparing these results to prior findings on SNLI and discuss possible reasons for the observed differences.	Computation and Language (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18288	Sun-Shine: A Large Language Model for Tibetan Culture	Cheng Huang, Fan Gao, Nyima Tashi, Yutong Liu, Xiangxiang Wang, Thupten Tsering, Ban Ma-bao, Renzeg Duojie, Gadeng Luosang, Rinchen Dongrub, Dorje Tashi, Xiao Feng, Yongbin Yu	Tibetan, a minority language in China, features a highly intricate grammatical structure, characterized by four verb tenses and a tense system with frequent irregularities, contributing to its extensive inflectional diversity. Recently, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the paradigm in many domains. Despite the success in other fields, current LLMs often fall short in catering to the needs of domain experts like Tibetans, and the potential of LLMs for Tibetan culture is under-explored. The intrinsic reasons are the immense and intricate nature of Tibetan culture as well as the necessity for higher granularity and richness in knowledge. Simultaneously, the complexity and uniqueness of its grammatical structure, coupled with its status as a minority ethnic language, contribute to data scarcity, which remains a fundamental challenge. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Llama-Sunshine (Sun-Shine), the first large language model for Tibetan culture, which is expert in various Tibetan language processing tasks. Sun-Shine incorporates state-of-the-art model architectures optimized for Tibetan's linguistic features. We also propose TIB-STC, a comprehensive dataset comprising diverse Tibetan texts such as literature, religious scripts, news, and conversational data, which is also the first large-scale dataset for Tibetan culture. Though comprehensive experiments, Sun-Shine not only demonstrates a higher level of knowledge expertise for Tibetan culture but also gains preliminary embodied intelligence capabilities in Tibetan language processing tasks, like language modeling, text classification, machine translation, and syntactic analysis. Moreover, it excels in low-resource scenarios, showcasing strong generalization capabilities.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025

Patil, Joshit Mohanty	Sentiment analysis is a field within NLP that has gained importance because it is applied in various areas such as; social media surveillance, customer feedback evaluation and market research. At the same time, distributed systems allow for effective processing of large amounts of data. Therefore, this paper examines how sentiment analysis converges with distributed systems by concentrating on different approaches, challenges and future investigations. Furthermore, we do an extensive experiment where we train sentiment analysis models using both single node configuration and distributed architecture to bring out the benefits and shortcomings of each method in terms of performance and accuracy.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18253	Enhancing Multi-Label Emotion Analysis and Corresponding Intensities for Ethiopian Languages	Tadesse Destaw Belay, Dawit Ketema Gete, Abinew Ali Ayele, Olga Kolesnikova, Grigori Sidorov, Seid Muhie Yimam	In this digital world, people freely express their emotions using different social media platforms. As a result, modeling and integrating emotion-understanding models are vital for various human-computer interaction tasks such as decision-making, product and customer feedback analysis, political promotions, marketing research, and social media monitoring. As users express different emotions simultaneously in a single instance, annotating emotions in a multilabel setting such as the EthioEmo (Belay et al., 2025) dataset effectively captures this dynamic. Additionally, incorporating intensity, or the degree of emotion, is crucial, as emotions can significantly differ in their expressive strength and impact. This intensity is significant for assessing whether further action is necessary in decision-making processes, especially concerning negative emotions in applications such as healthcare and mental health studies. To enhance the EthioEmo dataset, we include annotations for the intensity of each labeled emotion. Furthermore, we evaluate various state-of-the-art encoder-only Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and decoder-only Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide comprehensive benchmarking.

In this study, we explore the potential of Phrase Aligned Data (PAD) from standardized Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) to enhance the efficiency of transfer learning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PAD synergizes effectively with the syntactic characteristics of the Korean language, mitigating the weaknesses of SMT and significantly improving model performance. Moreover, we reveal that PAD complements traditional data construction methods and enhances their effectiveness when combined. This innovative approach not only boosts model performance but also suggests a cost-efficient solution for resource-scarce languages.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025

Language representations learned by such models achieve strong performance across many tasks with datasets of varying sizes drawn from various sources. We explore a thorough analysis of domain and task adaptive continual pretraining approaches for low-resource African languages and a promising result is shown for the evaluated tasks. We create AfriSocial, a corpus designed for domain adaptive finetuning that passes through quality pre-processing steps. Continual pretraining PLMs using AfriSocial as domain adaptive pretraining (DAPT) data, consistently improves performance on fine-grained emotion classification task of 16 targeted languages from 1% to 28.27% macro F1 score. Likewise, using the task adaptive pertaining (TAPT) approach, further finetuning with small unlabeled but similar task data shows promising results. For example, unlabeled sentiment data (source) for fine-grained emotion classification task (target) improves the base model results by an F1 score ranging from 0.55% to 15.11%. Combining the two methods, DAPT + TAPT, achieves also better results than base models. All the resources will be available to improve low-resource NLP tasks, generally, as well as other similar domain tasks such as hate speech and sentiment tasks.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18242	ShED-HD: A Shannon Entropy Distribution Framework for Lightweight Hallucination Detection on Edge Devices	Aneesh Vathul, Daniel Lee, Sheryl Chen, Arthi Tasmia	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities on a broad array of NLP tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations$\unicode{x2013}$plausible-sounding but factually incorrect content$\unicode{x2013}$poses severe challenges in high-stakes domains. Existing hallucination detection methods either bear the computational cost of multiple inference passes or sacrifice accuracy for efficiency with single-pass approaches, neither of which is ideal in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices. We propose the Shannon Entropy Distribution Hallucination Detector (ShED-HD), a novel hallucination detection framework that bridges this gap by classifying sequence-level entropy patterns using a lightweight BiLSTM architecture with single-headed attention. In contrast to prior approaches, ShED-HD efficiently detects distinctive uncertainty patterns across entire output sequences, preserving contextual awareness. Through in-depth evaluation on three datasets (BioASQ, TriviaQA, and Jeopardy Questions), we show that ShED-HD significantly outperforms other computationally efficient approaches in the out-of-distribution setting, while achieving comparable performance in the in-distribution setting. ShED-HD facilitates hallucination detection that is low-cost, accurate, and generalizable, improving the credibility of content generated by LLMs in resource-constrained environments where trustworthy AI functionality is crucial.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18226	Mapping Hymns and Organizing Concepts in the Rigveda: Quantitatively Connecting the Vedic Suktas	Venkatesh Bollineni, Igor Crk, Eren Gultepe	Accessing and gaining insight into the Rigveda poses a non-trivial challenge due to its extremely ancient Sanskrit language, poetic structure, and large volume of text. By using NLP techniques, this study identified topics and semantic connections of hymns within the Rigveda that were corroborated by seven well-known groupings of hymns. The 1,028 suktas (hymns) from the modern English translation of the Rigveda by Jamison and Brereton were preprocessed and sukta-level embeddings were obtained using, i) a novel adaptation of LSA, presented herein, ii) SBERT, and iii) Doc2Vec embeddings. Following an UMAP dimension reduction of the vectors, the network of suktas was formed using k-nearest neighbours. Then, community detection of topics in the sukta networks was performed with the Louvain, Leiden, and label propagation methods, whose statistical significance of the formed topics were determined using an appropriate null distribution. Only the novel adaptation of LSA using the Leiden method, had detected sukta topic networks that were significant (z = 2.726, p < .01) with a modularity score of 0.944. Of the seven famous sukta groupings analyzed (e.g., creation, funeral, water, etc.) the LSA derived network was successful in all seven cases, while Doc2Vec was not significant and failed to detect the relevant suktas. SBERT detected four of the famous suktas as separate groups, but mistakenly combined three of them into a single mixed group. Also, the SBERT network was not statistically significant.

This paper introduces LakotaBERT, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for Lakota, aiming to support language revitalization efforts. Our research has two primary objectives: (1) to create a comprehensive Lakota language corpus and (2) to develop a customized LLM for Lakota. We compiled a diverse corpus of 105K sentences in Lakota, English, and parallel texts from various sources, such as books and websites, emphasizing the cultural significance and historical context of the Lakota language. Utilizing the RoBERTa architecture, we pre-trained our model and conducted comparative evaluations against established models such as RoBERTa, BERT, and multilingual BERT. Initial results demonstrate a masked language modeling accuracy of 51% with a single ground truth assumption, showcasing performance comparable to that of English-based models. We also evaluated the model using additional metrics, such as precision and F1 score, to provide a comprehensive assessment of its capabilities. By integrating AI and linguistic methodologies, we aspire to enhance linguistic diversity and cultural resilience, setting a valuable precedent for leveraging technology in the revitalization of other endangered indigenous languages.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18182	Exploring Topic Trends in COVID-19 Research Literature using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization	Divya Patel, Vansh Parikh, Om Patel, Agam Shah, Bhaskar Chaudhury	In this work, we apply topic modeling using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to uncover the underlying thematic structure and its evolution within the extensive body of COVID-19 research literature. NMF factorizes the document-term matrix into two non-negative matrices, effectively representing the topics and their distribution across the documents. This helps us see how strongly documents relate to topics and how topics relate to words. We describe the complete methodology which involves a series of rigorous pre-processing steps to standardize the available text data while preserving the context of phrases, and subsequently feature extraction using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf), which assigns weights to words based on their frequency and rarity in the dataset. To ensure the robustness of our topic model, we conduct a stability analysis. This process assesses the stability scores of the NMF topic model for different numbers of topics, enabling us to select the optimal number of topics for our analysis. Through our analysis, we track the evolution of topics over time within the CORD-19 dataset. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the knowledge structure of the COVID-19 research landscape, providing a valuable resource for future research in this field.

To address them, we propose a modular pipeline for grounded response generation that operates on information nuggets-minimal, atomic units of relevant information extracted from retrieved documents. The multistage pipeline encompasses nugget detection, clustering, ranking, top cluster summarization, and fluency enhancement. It guarantees grounding in specific facts, facilitates source attribution, and ensures maximum information inclusion within length constraints. Extensive experiments on the TREC RAG'24 dataset evaluated with the AutoNuggetizer framework demonstrate that GINGER achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark.

Despite decades of research, misleading visualizations remain a widespread and pressing issue. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong chart comprehension capabilities, yet no existing work has systematically evaluated their ability to detect and interpret misleading charts. This paper introduces the Misleading Chart Question Answering (Misleading ChartQA) Benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to assess MLLMs in identifying and reasoning about misleading charts. It contains over 3,000 curated examples, covering 21 types of misleaders and 10 chart types. Each example includes standardized chart code, CSV data, and multiple-choice questions with labeled explanations, validated through multi-round MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs on our dataset, revealing their limitations in identifying visually deceptive practices. We also propose a novel pipeline that detects and localizes misleaders, enhancing MLLMs' accuracy in misleading chart interpretation. Our work establishes a foundation for advancing MLLM-driven misleading chart comprehension. We publicly release the sample dataset to support further research in this critical area.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18167	Evaluating Negative Sampling Approaches for Neural Topic Models	Suman Adhya, Avishek Lahiri, Debarshi Kumar Sanyal, Partha Pratim Das	Negative sampling has emerged as an effective technique that enables deep learning models to learn better representations by introducing the paradigm of learn-to-compare. The goal of this approach is to add robustness to deep learning models to learn better representation by comparing the positive samples against the negative ones. Despite its numerous demonstrations in various areas of computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive study of the effect of negative sampling in an unsupervised domain like topic modeling has not been well explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the impact of different negative sampling strategies on neural topic models. We compare the performance of several popular neural topic models by incorporating a negative sampling technique in the decoder of variational autoencoder-based neural topic models. Experiments on four publicly available datasets demonstrate that integrating negative sampling into topic models results in significant enhancements across multiple aspects, including improved topic coherence, richer topic diversity, and more accurate document classification. Manual evaluations also indicate that the inclusion of negative sampling into neural topic models enhances the quality of the generated topics. These findings highlight the potential of negative sampling as a valuable tool for advancing the effectiveness of neural topic models.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18132	MathAgent: Leveraging a Mixture-of-Math-Agent Framework for Real-World Multimodal Mathematical Error Detection	Yibo Yan, Shen Wang, Jiahao Huo, Philip S. Yu, Xuming Hu, Qingsong Wen	Mathematical error detection in educational settings presents a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), requiring a sophisticated understanding of both visual and textual mathematical content along with complex reasoning capabilities. Though effective in mathematical problem-solving, MLLMs often struggle with the nuanced task of identifying and categorizing student errors in multimodal mathematical contexts. Therefore, we introduce MathAgent, a novel Mixture-of-Math-Agent framework designed specifically to address these challenges. Our approach decomposes error detection into three phases, each handled by a specialized agent: an image-text consistency validator, a visual semantic interpreter, and an integrative error analyzer. This architecture enables more accurate processing of mathematical content by explicitly modeling relationships between multimodal problems and student solution steps. We evaluate MathAgent on real-world educational data, demonstrating approximately 5% higher accuracy in error step identification and 3% improvement in error categorization compared to baseline models. Besides, MathAgent has been successfully deployed in an educational platform that has served over one million K-12 students, achieving nearly 90% student satisfaction while generating significant cost savings by reducing manual error detection.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18129	GeoBenchX: Benchmarking LLMs for Multistep Geospatial Tasks	Varvara Krechetova, Denis Kochedykov	In this paper, we establish a benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) on multi-step geospatial tasks relevant to commercial GIS practitioners. We assess seven leading commercial LLMs (Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7, Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2.0, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and o3-mini) using a simple tool-calling agent equipped with 23 geospatial functions. Our benchmark comprises tasks across four categories of increasing complexity, with both solvable and intentionally unsolvable tasks to test hallucination rejection. We develop an LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework to compare agent solutions against reference implementations. Results show Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4o achieve the best overall performance, with Claude models excelling on solvable tasks while OpenAI models better identify unsolvable scenarios. We observe significant differences in token usage, with Anthropic models consuming substantially more tokens than competitors. Common errors include misunderstanding geometrical relationships, relying on outdated knowledge, and inefficient data manipulation. The resulting benchmark set, evaluation framework, and data generation pipeline are released as open-source resources, providing one more standardized method for ongoing evaluation of LLMs for GeoAI.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18117	Detection of Somali-written Fake News and Toxic Messages on the Social Media Using Transformer-based Language Models	Muhidin A. Mohamed, Shuab D. Ahmed, Yahye A. Isse, Hanad M. Mohamed, Fuad M. Hassan, Houssein A. Assowe	The fact that everyone with a social media account can create and share content, and the increasing public reliance on social media platforms as a news and information source bring about significant challenges such as misinformation, fake news, harmful content, etc. Although human content moderation may be useful to an extent and used by these platforms to flag posted materials, the use of AI models provides a more sustainable, scalable, and effective way to mitigate these harmful contents. However, low-resourced languages such as the Somali language face limitations in AI automation, including scarce annotated training datasets and lack of language models tailored to their unique linguistic characteristics. This paper presents part of our ongoing research work to bridge some of these gaps for the Somali language. In particular, we created two human-annotated social-media-sourced Somali datasets for two downstream applications, fake news \& toxicity classification, and developed a transformer-based monolingual Somali language model (named SomBERTa) -- the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge. SomBERTa is then fine-tuned and evaluated on toxic content, fake news and news topic classification datasets. Comparative evaluation analysis of the proposed model against related multilingual models (e.g., AfriBERTa, AfroXLMR, etc) demonstrated that SomBERTa consistently outperformed these comparators in both fake news and toxic content classification tasks while achieving the best average accuracy (87.99%) across all tasks. This research contributes to Somali NLP by offering a foundational language model and a replicable framework for other low-resource languages, promoting digital and AI inclusivity and linguistic diversity.

M. Sousa	Background Advances in machine learning (ML) models have increased the capability of researchers to detect vaccine hesitancy in social media using Natural Language Processing (NLP). A considerable volume of research has identified the persistence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in discourse shared on various social media platforms. Methods Our objective in this study was to conduct a systematic review of research employing sentiment analysis or stance detection to study discourse towards COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination spread on Twitter (officially known as X since 2023). Following registration in the PROSPERO international registry of systematic reviews, we searched papers published from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2023 that used supervised machine learning to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy through stance detection or sentiment analysis on Twitter. We categorized the studies according to a taxonomy of five dimensions: tweet sample selection approach, self-reported study type, classification typology, annotation codebook definitions, and interpretation of results. We analyzed if studies using stance detection report different hesitancy trends than those using sentiment analysis by examining how COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is measured, and whether efforts were made to avoid measurement bias. Results Our review found that measurement bias is widely prevalent in studies employing supervised machine learning to analyze sentiment and stance toward COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination. The reporting errors are sufficiently serious that they hinder the generalisability and interpretation of these studies to understanding whether individual opinions communicate reluctance to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Improving the reporting of NLP methods is crucial to addressing knowledge gaps in vaccine hesitancy discourse.

Tuning large language models in scarce data scenarios is crucial, particularly given that the convergence speed of the LoRA method is lower than that of full fine-tuning. In this paper, we present an analysis of post-training methods including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) within the context of task-specific learning using the LoRA method. Next we introduce $D^2LoRA$, a data-driven approach for initializing LoRA metrics that enhances training efficiency, especially in limited-data settings. Our experiments compare $D^2LoRA$ with vanilla LoRA in terms of performance and catastrophic forgetting under extremely data-constrained conditions. The results demonstrate that $D^2LoRA$ achieves a 1% improvement GSM8K benchmark and a 2-point improvement in ROUGE score in title generation tasks. $D^2LoRA$ facilitates the adaptation of LLMs to multiple tasks even when task-specific data is scarce, thereby reducing training expenses and offering data cost.

We address the task of extracting clinical events and their temporal relations using the well-studied I2B2 2012 Temporal Relations Challenge corpus. This task is inherently challenging due to complex clinical language, long documents, and sparse annotations. We introduce GRAPHTREX, a novel method integrating span-based entity-relation extraction, clinical large pre-trained language models (LPLMs), and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) to capture local and global dependencies. Our HGT component facilitates information propagation across the document through innovative global landmarks that bridge distant entities. Our method improves the state-of-the-art with 5.5% improvement in the tempeval $F_1$ score over the previous best and up to 8.9% improvement on long-range relations, which presents a formidable challenge. This work not only advances temporal information extraction but also lays the groundwork for improved diagnostic and prognostic models through enhanced temporal reasoning.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18076	A Multi-Model Adaptation of Speculative Decoding for Classification	Somnath Roy, Padharthi Sreekar, Srivatsa Narasimha, Anubhav Anand	The current study introduces a novel adaptation of speculative decoding, repurposed from generation to classification tasks. We propose a multi-model framework employing up to three lightweight worker models and a single, more robust judge model analogous to draft models and target model, respectively, in speculative decoding. The worker models, tasked with the bulk of the computation, independently predict discrete class labels for a given input. When majority worker models agree on a label, it is accepted as the final label, optimizing efficiency by bypassing the computationally expensive judge model. In cases of disagreement, the judge model intervenes to resolve the label. This approach minimizes redundant computation, leverages the redundancy of multiple workers for confidence, and confines the judge model's role to challenging cases, offering a practical balance of efficiency and accuracy. Our analysis suggests that smaller out of the box instruction/chat finetuned worker models with 3 billion parameters (hereafter, 3B) demonstrate a level of alignment with judge models comparable to that of larger finetuned worker models with 7 billion parameters (hereafter, 7B) across both simple and higher order reasoning tasks. The top performing 3B worker model pair achieve an agreement rate of approximately 80-83% for sentiment and around 50-80% for similar ticket when compared to judge models. Additionally, 3B worker models provide a speedup ranging from 2.8x to 9x relative to the judge models, while 7B worker model combinations achieve a speedup ranging from 1.28x to 0.28x	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	23/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18072	On the effectiveness of LLMs for automatic grading of open-ended questions in Spanish	GermÃ¡n Capdehourat, Isabel Amigo, Brian Lorenzo, JoaquÃ­n Trigo	Grading is a time-consuming and laborious task that educators must face. It is an important task since it provides feedback signals to learners, and it has been demonstrated that timely feedback improves the learning process. In recent years, the irruption of LLMs has shed light on the effectiveness of automatic grading. In this paper, we explore the performance of different LLMs and prompting techniques in automatically grading short-text answers to open-ended questions. Unlike most of the literature, our study focuses on a use case where the questions, answers, and prompts are all in Spanish. Experimental results comparing automatic scores to those of human-expert evaluators show good outcomes in terms of accuracy, precision and consistency for advanced LLMs, both open and proprietary. Results are notably sensitive to prompt styles, suggesting biases toward certain words or content in the prompt. However, the best combinations of models and prompt strategies, consistently surpasses an accuracy of 95% in a three-level grading task, which even rises up to more than 98% when the it is simplified to a binary right or wrong rating problem, which demonstrates the potential that LLMs have to implement this type of automation in education applications.

This survey provides a systematic overview of the recent multimodal reasoning approaches, categorizing them into two levels: language-centric multimodal reasoning and collaborative multimodal reasoning. The former encompasses one-pass visual perception and active visual perception, where vision primarily serves a supporting role in language reasoning. The latter involves action generation and state update within reasoning process, enabling a more dynamic interaction between modalities. Furthermore, we analyze the technical evolution of these methods, discuss their inherent challenges, and introduce key benchmark tasks and evaluation metrics for assessing multimodal reasoning performance. Finally, we provide insights into future research directions from the following two perspectives: (i) from visual-language reasoning to omnimodal reasoning and (ii) from multimodal reasoning to multimodal agents. This survey aims to provide a structured overview that will inspire further advancements in multimodal reasoning research.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	23/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18069	Long Is More Important Than Difficult for Training Reasoning Models	Si Shen, Fei Huang, Zhixiao Zhao, Chang Liu, Tiansheng Zheng, Danhao Zhu	Difficult problems, which often result in long reasoning traces, are widely recognized as key factors for enhancing the performance of reasoning models. However, such high-challenge problems are scarce, limiting the size of available datasets. In this paper, we propose a simple method to decouple the reliance on problem difficulty. First, we empirically demonstrate that reasoning length, rather than problem difficulty, primarily influences the performance of trained models. Second, we identify a scaling law on reasoning length, showing that model performance increases in a log-linear fashion as the reasoning data length grows. Finally, we introduce a straightforward technique to generate reasoning data of arbitrary length, and show that synthesized data is effective for training reasoning models. After fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct language model on our Long1K dataset, we present our model, Long1K-32B, which achieves remarkable performance with only 1,000 training samples, achieving 95.6\% accuracy on MATH, and 71.1\% on GPQA outperforming DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18063	Dynamic Task Vector Grouping for Efficient Multi-Task Prompt Tuning	Pieyi Zhang, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie	Multi-task prompt tuning utilizes multiple high-resource source tasks to improve performance on low-source target tasks. Existing approaches transfer the soft prompt trained by combining all source tasks or a single ``high-similar'' source task one-time-only. However, we find that the optimal transfer performance often comes from a combination of source tasks, which is neither one nor all. Further, we find that the similarity between source and target tasks also changes dynamically during fine-tuning after transfering, making similarity calculation in the initiation stage inadequate. To address these issues, we propose a method called Dynamic Task Vector Grouping (DTVG), whose core ideas contain (1) measuring the task similarity with task vectors instead of soft prompt, (2) grouping the optimal source task combination based on two metrics: {\it target similarity} and {\it knowledge consistency}; (3) dynamically updating the combination in each iteration step. Extensive experiments on the 26 NLP datasets under different settings demonstrate that DTVG effectively groups similar source tasks while reducing negative transfer, achieving the start-of-art performance.

In this paper, we fine-tune and evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs: Llama 3 (8B parameters) and Gemma (7B parameters), on ViMMRC, a Vietnamese MRC dataset. By utilizing Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA), we efficiently fine-tune these models and compare their performance against powerful LLM-based baselines. Although our fine-tuned models are smaller than GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, they outperform both traditional BERT-based approaches and these larger models. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our fine-tuning process, showcasing how modern LLMs can surpass the capabilities of older models like BERT while still being suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Through intensive analyses, we explore various aspects of model performance, providing valuable insights into adapting LLMs for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. Our study contributes to the advancement of natural language processing in low-resource languages, and we make our fine-tuned models publicly available at: this https URL.

Prompt-based methods augment queries with user preference information, whereas training-based methods directly encode preferences into model parameters for more effective personalization. Despite achieving some success in personalizing LLMs, prior methods often fail to directly optimize task-specific metrics and lack explicit privacy-preservation mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose Privacy-Preserving Model Merging via Evolutionary Algorithms (PriME), a novel approach to personalization that employs gradient-free methods to directly optimize task-specific metrics while preserving user privacy. By incorporating privacy preservation into optimization, PriME produces a personalized module that effectively captures the target user's preferences while minimizing the privacy risks for the users sharing their private information. Experiments on the LaMP benchmark show that PriME outperforms both prompt-based and training-based methods, achieving up to a 45% performance improvement over the prior art. Further analysis shows that PriME achieves a significantly better privacy-utility trade-off, highlighting the potential of evolutionary approaches for privacy-preserving LLM personalization.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17994	Instructing the Architecture Search for Spatial-temporal Sequence Forecasting with LLM	Xin Xue, Haoyi Zhou, Tianyu Chen, Shuai Zhang, Yizhou Long, Jianxin Li	Spatial-temporal sequence forecasting (STSF) is a long-standing research problem with widespread real-world applications. Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the neural network design, has been shown effective in tackling the STSF problem. However, the existing NAS methods for STSF focus on generating architectures in a time-consuming data-driven fashion, which heavily limits their ability to use background knowledge and explore the complicated search trajectory. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it could benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method for STSF based on LLM. Instead of directly generate architectures with LLM, We inspire the LLM's capability with a multi-level enhancement mechanism. Specifically, on the step-level, we decompose the generation task into decision steps with powerful prompt engineering and inspire LLM to serve as instructor for architecture search based on its internal knowledge. On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning framework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to cumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability. On the task-level, we propose a two-stage architecture search, balancing the exploration stage and optimization stage, to reduce the possibility of being trapped in local optima. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive effectiveness with superior efficiency against existing NAS methods for STSF.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17965	Understanding the Effects of RLHF on the Quality and Detectability of LLM-Generated Texts	Beining Xu, Arkaitz Zubiaga	Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on a range of downstream NLP tasks by generating text that closely resembles human writing. However, the ease of achieving this similarity raises concerns from potential malicious uses at scale by bad actors, as LLM-generated text becomes increasingly difficult to discern from human text. Although detection methods have been developed to address this issue, bad actors can further manipulate LLM-generated texts to make them less detectable. In this work, we study how further editing texts with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which aligns model outputs with human preferences, affects (a) the quality of generated texts for two tasks, and (b) the performance of LLM-generated text detectors, looking at both training-based and zero-shot detection methods. Although RLHF improves the quality of LLM-generated texts, we find that it also tends to produce more detectable, lengthy, and repetitive outputs. Additionally, we observe that training-based detectors are vulnerable to short texts and to texts that incorporate code, whereas zero-shot detectors exhibit greater robustness.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17963	Won: Establishing Best Practices for Korean Financial NLP	Guijin Son, Hyunwoo Ko, Haneral Jung, Chami Hwang	In this work, we present the first open leaderboard for evaluating Korean large language models focused on finance. Operated for about eight weeks, the leaderboard evaluated 1,119 submissions on a closed benchmark covering five MCQA categories: finance and accounting, stock price prediction, domestic company analysis, financial markets, and financial agent tasks and one open-ended qa task. Building on insights from these evaluations, we release an open instruction dataset of 80k instances and summarize widely used training strategies observed among top-performing models. Finally, we introduce Won, a fully open and transparent LLM built using these best practices. We hope our contributions help advance the development of better and safer financial LLMs for Korean and other languages.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	23/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.17952	SLIDE: Sliding Localized Information for Document Extraction	Divyansh Singh, Manuel Nunez Martinez, Bonnie J. Dorr, Sonja Schmer Galunder	Constructing accurate knowledge graphs from long texts and low-resource languages is challenging, as large language models (LLMs) experience degraded performance with longer input chunks. This problem is amplified in low-resource settings where data scarcity hinders accurate entity and relationship extraction. Contextual retrieval methods, while improving retrieval accuracy, struggle with long documents. They truncate critical information in texts exceeding maximum context lengths of LLMs, significantly limiting knowledge graph construction. We introduce SLIDE (Sliding Localized Information for Document Extraction), a chunking method that processes long documents by generating local context through overlapping windows. SLIDE ensures that essential contextual information is retained, enhancing knowledge graph extraction from documents exceeding LLM context limits. It significantly improves GraphRAG performance, achieving a 24% increase in entity extraction and a 39% improvement in relationship extraction for English. For Afrikaans, a low-resource language, SLIDE achieves a 49% increase in entity extraction and an 82% improvement in relationship extraction. Furthermore, it improves upon state-of-the-art in question-answering metrics such as comprehensiveness, diversity and empowerment, demonstrating its effectiveness in multilingual and resource-constrained settings.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17936	An Empirical Study of the Role of Incompleteness and Ambiguity in Interactions with Large Language Models	Riya Naik, Ashwin Srinivasan, Estrid He, Swati Agarwal	Natural language as a medium for human-computer interaction has long been anticipated, has been undergoing a sea-change with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with startling capacities for processing and generating language. Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles, asking it almost any kind of question. Unlike its Delphic predecessor, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single-turn activity (ask a question, receive an answer, leave); and -- also unlike the Pythia -- it is widely acknowledged that answers from LLMs can be improved with additional context. In this paper, we aim to study when we need multi-turn interactions with LLMs to successfully get a question answered; or conclude that a question is unanswerable. We present a neural symbolic framework that models the interactions between human and LLM agents. Through the proposed framework, we define incompleteness and ambiguity in the questions as properties deducible from the messages exchanged in the interaction, and provide results from benchmark problems, in which the answer-correctness is shown to depend on whether or not questions demonstrate the presence of incompleteness or ambiguity (according to the properties we identify). Our results show multi-turn interactions are usually required for datasets which have a high proportion of incompleteness or ambiguous questions; and that that increasing interaction length has the effect of reducing incompleteness or ambiguity. The results also suggest that our measures of incompleteness and ambiguity can be useful tools for characterising interactions with an LLM on question-answeringproblems	Computation and Language (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	23/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.17933	Experience Retrieval-Augmentation with Electronic Health Records Enables Accurate Discharge QA	Justice Ou, Tinglin Huang, Yilun Zhao, Ziyang Yu, Peiqing Lu, Rex Ying	To improve the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is extensively applied to provide factual medical knowledge. However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences. Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval Augmentation - ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record (EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning. To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17932	STShield: Single-Token Sentinel for Real-Time Jailbreak Detection in Large Language Models	Xunguang Wang, Wenxuan Wang, Zhenlan Ji, Zongjie Li, Pingchuan Ma, Daoyuan Wu, Shuai Wang	Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their safety mechanisms. While existing defense methods either suffer from adaptive attacks or require computationally expensive auxiliary models, we present STShield, a lightweight framework for real-time jailbroken judgement. STShield introduces a novel single-token sentinel mechanism that appends a binary safety indicator to the model's response sequence, leveraging the LLM's own alignment capabilities for detection. Our framework combines supervised fine-tuning on normal prompts with adversarial training using embedding-space perturbations, achieving robust detection while preserving model utility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STShield successfully defends against various jailbreak attacks, while maintaining the model's performance on legitimate queries. Compared to existing approaches, STShield achieves superior defense performance with minimal computational overhead, making it a practical solution for real-world LLM deployment.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17922	WindowKV: Task-Adaptive Group-Wise KV Cache Window Selection for Efficient LLM Inference	Youhui Zuo, Sibo Wei, Chen Zhang, Zhuorui Liu, Wenpeng Lu, Dawei Song	With the advancements in long-context inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the KV cache has become one of the foundational components. However, its substantial GPU memory consumption makes KV cache compression a key technique for enabling efficient LLM inference in industrial scenarios. While recent studies have focused on optimizing the memory occupied by the KV cache, they overlook two critical factors: preserving semantic coherence and considering task-specific characteristic during compression. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task-adaptive KV cache window selection method, WindowKV. WindowKV dynamically selects local semantic windows consisting of consecutive tokens, according to task-specific characteristics, ensuring the retained KV cache captures continuous, essential context. Additionally, we introduce an intra-group layer KV cache indices sharing strategy to reduce computational overhead, achieving a balance between performance and efficiency. We rigorously evaluate WindowKV on the LongBench benchmark, and the results demonstrate that it maintains a performance comparable to full KV cache retention while using only 12% of the original KV cache, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, our method also achieves state-of-the-art results in the Needle-in-a-Haystack evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	23/03/2025

We identify three critical limitations in current approaches: they generate treatment plans in a single pass rather than following the sequential reasoning process used by clinicians; they rarely incorporate patient-specific historical context; and they fail to effectively distinguish between subjective and objective clinical information. Motivated by the SOAP methodology (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), we introduce MedPlan, a novel framework that structures LLM reasoning to align with real-life clinician workflows. Our approach employs a two-stage architecture that first generates a clinical assessment based on patient symptoms and objective data, then formulates a structured treatment plan informed by this assessment and enriched with patient-specific information through retrieval-augmented generation. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in both assessment accuracy and treatment plan quality.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	23/03/2025

In practice, such ""harmlessness"" behavior is mainly achieved by training models to reject harmful requests, such as ""Explain how to burn down my neighbor's house"", where the model appropriately declines to respond. However, this approach can inadvertently result in false refusal, where models reject benign queries as well, such as ""Tell me how to kill a Python process"". In this work, we demonstrate that prompting safety reflection before generating a response can mitigate false refusal behavior. Building on this finding, we introduce the Think-Before-Refusal (TBR) schema and conduct safety-aware instruction fine-tuning incorporating safety reflection. In an ablation study across 15 pre-trained models, we show that models fine-tuned with safety reflection significantly reduce false refusal behavior while maintaining safety and overall performance compared to those fine-tuned without safety reflection."

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17876	Satisfactory Medical Consultation based on Terminology-Enhanced Information Retrieval and Emotional In-Context Learning	Kaiwen Zuo, Jing Tang, Hanbing Qin, Binli Luo, Ligang He, Shiyan Tang	Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have marked significant progress in understanding and responding to medical inquiries. However, their performance still falls short of the standards set by professional consultations. This paper introduces a novel framework for medical consultation, comprising two main modules: Terminology-Enhanced Information Retrieval (TEIR) and Emotional In-Context Learning (EICL). TEIR ensures implicit reasoning through the utilization of inductive knowledge and key terminology retrieval, overcoming the limitations of restricted domain knowledge in public databases. Additionally, this module features capabilities for processing long context. The EICL module aids in generating sentences with high attribute relevance by memorizing semantic and attribute information from unlabelled corpora and applying controlled retrieval for the required information. Furthermore, a dataset comprising 803,564 consultation records was compiled in China, significantly enhancing the model's capability for complex dialogues and proactive inquiry initiation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in extending the context window length of existing LLMs. The experimental outcomes and extensive data validate the framework's superiority over five baseline models in terms of BLEU and ROUGE performance metrics, with substantial leads in certain capabilities. Notably, ablation studies confirm the significance of the TEIR and EICL components. In addition, our new framework has the potential to significantly improve patient satisfaction in real clinical consulting situations.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17860	Enhancing Retrieval Systems with Inference-Time Logical Reasoning	Felix Faltings, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao	Traditional retrieval methods rely on transforming user queries into vector representations and retrieving documents based on cosine similarity within an embedding space. While efficient and scalable, this approach often fails to handle complex queries involving logical constructs such as negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time logical reasoning framework that explicitly incorporates logical reasoning into the retrieval process. Our method extracts logical reasoning structures from natural language queries and then composes the individual cosine similarity scores to formulate the final document scores. This approach enables the retrieval process to handle complex logical reasoning without compromising computational efficiency. Our results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional retrieval methods across different models and datasets, significantly improving retrieval performance for complex queries.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17811	Feather-SQL: A Lightweight NL2SQL Framework with Dual-Model Collaboration Paradigm for Small Language Models	Wenqi Pei, Hailing Xu, Hengyuan Zhao, Shizheng Hou, Han Chen, Zining Zhang, Pingyi Luo, Bingsheng He	Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) has seen significant advancements with large language models (LLMs). However, these models often depend on closed-source systems and high computational resources, posing challenges in data privacy and deployment. In contrast, small language models (SLMs) struggle with NL2SQL tasks, exhibiting poor performance and incompatibility with existing frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce Feather-SQL, a new lightweight framework tailored for SLMs. Feather-SQL improves SQL executability and accuracy through 1) schema pruning and linking, 2) multi-path and multi-candidate generation. Additionally, we introduce the 1+1 Model Collaboration Paradigm, which pairs a strong general-purpose chat model with a fine-tuned SQL specialist, combining strong analytical reasoning with high-precision SQL generation. Experimental results on BIRD demonstrate that Feather-SQL improves NL2SQL performance on SLMs, with around 10% boost for models without fine-tuning. The proposed paradigm raises the accuracy ceiling of SLMs to 54.76%, highlighting its effectiveness.	Computation and Language (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), Databases (cs.DB)	22/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.17810	ParsiPy: NLP Toolkit for Historical Persian Texts in Python	Farhan Farsi, Parnian Fazel, Sepand Haghighi, Sadra Sabouri, Farzaneh Goshtasb, Nadia Hajipour, Ehsaneddin Asgari, Hossein Sameti	The study of historical languages presents unique challenges due to their complex orthographic systems, fragmentary textual evidence, and the absence of standardized digital representations of text in those languages. Tackling these challenges needs special NLP digital tools to handle phonetic transcriptions and analyze ancient texts. This work introduces ParsiPy, an NLP toolkit designed to facilitate the analysis of historical Persian languages by offering modules for tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, phoneme-to-transliteration conversion, and word embedding. We demonstrate the utility of our toolkit through the processing of Parsig (Middle Persian) texts, highlighting its potential for expanding computational methods in the study of historical languages. Through this work, we contribute to computational philology, offering tools that can be adapted for the broader study of ancient texts and their digital preservation.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17799	Relation Extraction with Instance-Adapted Predicate Descriptions	Yuhang Jiang, Ramakanth Kavuluru	Relation extraction (RE) is a standard information extraction task playing a major role in downstream applications such as knowledge discovery and question answering. Although decoder-only large language models are excelling in generative tasks, smaller encoder models are still the go to architecture for RE. In this paper, we revisit fine-tuning such smaller models using a novel dual-encoder architecture with a joint contrastive and cross-entropy loss. Unlike previous methods that employ a fixed linear layer for predicate representations, our approach uses a second encoder to compute instance-specific predicate representations by infusing them with real entity spans from corresponding input instances. We conducted experiments on two biomedical RE datasets and two general domain datasets. Our approach achieved F1 score improvements ranging from 1% to 2% over state-of-the-art methods with a simple but elegant formulation. Ablation studies justify the importance of various components built into the proposed architecture.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	22/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.17755	Improving Preference Extraction In LLMs By Identifying Latent Knowledge Through Classifying Probes	Sharan Maiya, Yinhong Liu, Ramit Debnath, Anna Korhonen	Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used as automated judges to evaluate text, but their effectiveness can be hindered by various unintentional biases. We propose using linear classifying probes, trained by leveraging differences between contrasting pairs of prompts, to directly access LLMs' latent knowledge and extract more accurate preferences. Through extensive experiments using models of varying size from four different families and six diverse datasets assessing text quality evaluation and common sense reasoning, we demonstrate that both supervised and unsupervised probing approaches consistently outperform traditional generation-based judgement while maintaining similar computational costs. These probes generalise under domain shifts and can even outperform finetuned evaluators with the same training data size. Our results suggest linear probing offers an accurate, robust and computationally efficient approach for LLM-as-judge tasks while providing interpretable insights into how models encode judgement-relevant knowledge. Our data and code will be openly released in the future.	Computation and Language (cs.CL), Machine Learning (cs.LG)	22/03/2025

This paper presents Tox-chat, a Korean chemical toxicity information agent devised within these limitations. We propose two key innovations: a context-efficient architecture that reduces token consumption through hierarchical section search, and a scenario-based dialogue generation methodology that effectively distills tool-using capabilities from larger models. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our fine-tuned 8B parameter model substantially outperforms both untuned models and baseline approaches, in terms of DB faithfulness and preference. Our work offers valuable insights for researchers developing domain-specific language agents under practical constraints.	Computation and Language (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	22/03/2025

Arabic AES systems are particularly challenged by the lack of annotated essay datasets. This paper presents a novel framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transformers to generate synthetic Arabic essay datasets for AES. We prompt an LLM to generate essays across CEFR proficiency levels and introduce controlled error injection using a fine-tuned Standard Arabic BERT model for error type prediction. Our approach produces realistic human-like essays, contributing a dataset of 3,040 annotated essays. Additionally, we develop a BERT-based auto-marking system for accurate and scalable Arabic essay evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving Arabic AES performance.	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	22/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.17684	Can LLMs Automate Fact-Checking Article Writing?	Dhruv Sahnan, David Corney, Irene Larraz, Giovanni Zagni, Ruben Miguez, Zhuohan Xie, Iryna Gurevych, Elizabeth Churchill, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Preslav Nakov	Automatic fact-checking aims to support professional fact-checkers by offering tools that can help speed up manual fact-checking. Yet, existing frameworks fail to address the key step of producing output suitable for broader dissemination to the general public: while human fact-checkers communicate their findings through fact-checking articles, automated systems typically produce little or no justification for their assessments. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. We argue for the need to extend the typical automatic fact-checking pipeline with automatic generation of full fact-checking articles. We first identify key desiderata for such articles through a series of interviews with experts from leading fact-checking organizations. We then develop QRAFT, an LLM-based agentic framework that mimics the writing workflow of human fact-checkers. Finally, we assess the practical usefulness of QRAFT through human evaluations with professional fact-checkers. Our evaluation shows that while QRAFT outperforms several previously proposed text-generation approaches, it lags considerably behind expert-written articles. We hope that our work will enable further research in this new and important direction.	Computation and Language (cs.CL), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	22/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.17662	Enhancing Persona Consistency for LLMs' Role-Playing using Persona-Aware Contrastive Learning	Ke Ji, Yixin Lian, Linxu Li, Jingsheng Gao, Weiyuan Li, Bin Dai	In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved breakthrough progress in many dialogue generation tasks. However, their lack of emotion and fine-grained role awareness limits the model's ability to provide personalized and diverse interactions further. Current methods face high costs in collecting high-quality annotated data for scenarios such as role-playing, and traditional human alignment methods are difficult to deploy due to the inherent diversity of model behavior in role-playing scenarios. Inspired by the alignment of models for safety behaviors through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), in this paper, we revisit model role-playing behavior from the perspective of persona alignment and propose a novel annotation-free framework named \textbf{\underline{P}}ersona-Aware \textbf{\underline{C}}ontrastive \textbf{\underline{L}}earning (PCL) to align LLMs' behavior during role-playing, enhancing the model's role consistency. Specifically, we first design a role chain method to encourage the model to self-question based on the role characteristics and dialogue context to adjust personality consistency. Then, we further enhance the model's role-playing strategy through iterative contrastive learning between the use of role characteristics and not. Experiments on both black-box and white-box LLMs show that LLMs equipped with PCL significantly outperform vanilla LLMs under automatic evaluation methods (CharEval \& GPT-4) and human expert evaluation.

However, due to community-oriented nature of their practice, uneven training and resource gaps, the clinical proficiency among GPs can vary significantly across regions and healthcare settings. Currently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in clinical and medical applications, making them a promising tool for supporting general practice. However, most existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks focus on exam-style assessments-typically multiple-choice question-lack comprehensive assessment sets that accurately mirror the real-world scenarios encountered by GPs. To evaluate how effectively LLMs can make decisions in the daily work of GPs, we designed GPBench, which consists of both test questions from clinical practice and a novel evaluation framework. The test set includes multiple-choice questions that assess fundamental knowledge of general practice, as well as realistic, scenario-based problems. All questions are meticulously annotated by experts, incorporating rich fine-grained information related to clinical management. The proposed LLM evaluation framework is based on the competency model for general practice, providing a comprehensive methodology for assessing LLM performance in real-world settings. As the first large-model evaluation set targeting GP decision-making scenarios, GPBench allows us to evaluate current mainstream LLMs. Expert assessment and evaluation reveal that in areas such as disease staging, complication recognition, treatment detail, and medication usage, these models exhibit at least ten major shortcomings. Overall, existing LLMs are not yet suitable for independent use in real-world GP working scenarios without human oversight.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17579	Leveraging Human Production-Interpretation Asymmetries to Test LLM Cognitive Plausibility	Suet-Ying Lam, Qingcheng Zeng, Jingyi Wu, Rob Voigt	Whether large language models (LLMs) process language similarly to humans has been the subject of much theoretical and practical debate. We examine this question through the lens of the production-interpretation distinction found in human sentence processing and evaluate the extent to which instruction-tuned LLMs replicate this distinction. Using an empirically documented asymmetry between production and interpretation in humans for implicit causality verbs as a testbed, we find that some LLMs do quantitatively and qualitatively reflect human-like asymmetries between production and interpretation. We demonstrate that whether this behavior holds depends upon both model size - with larger models more likely to reflect human-like patterns and the choice of meta-linguistic prompts used to elicit the behavior.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17523	Bayesian Teaching Enables Probabilistic Reasoning in Large Language Models	Linlu Qiu, Fei Sha, Kelsey Allen, Yoon Kim, Tal Linzen, Sjoerd van Steenkiste	Artificial intelligence systems based on large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as agents that interact with users and with the world. To do so successfully, LLMs need to construct internal representations of the world and form probabilistic beliefs about those representations. To provide a user with personalized recommendations, for example, the LLM needs to gradually infer the user's preferences, over the course of multiple interactions. To evaluate whether contemporary LLMs are able to do so, we use the Bayesian inference framework from probability theory, which lays out the optimal way to update an agent's beliefs as it receives new information. We first show that the LLMs do not update their beliefs as expected from the Bayesian framework, and that consequently their predictions do not improve as expected as more information becomes available, even less so than we find is the case for humans. To address this issue, we teach the LLMs to reason in a Bayesian manner by training them to mimic the predictions of an optimal Bayesian model. We find that this approach not only significantly improves the LLM's performance on the particular recommendation task it is trained on, but also enables generalization to other tasks. This suggests that this method endows the LLM with broader Bayesian reasoning skills. More generally, our results indicate that LLMs can learn about reasoning strategies effectively and generalize those skills to new domains, which in part explains LLMs' empirical success.

Choquette-Choo, Matthew Jagielski, Peter Kairouz, Sanmi Koyejo, Percy Liang, Nicolas Papernot	An important question today is whether a given text was used to train a large language model (LLM). A \emph{completion} test is often employed: check if the LLM completes a sufficiently complex text. This, however, requires a ground-truth definition of membership; most commonly, it is defined as a member based on the $n$-gram overlap between the target text and any text in the dataset. In this work, we demonstrate that this $n$-gram based membership definition can be effectively gamed. We study scenarios where sequences are \emph{non-members} for a given $n$ and we find that completion tests still succeed. We find many natural cases of this phenomenon by retraining LLMs from scratch after removing all training samples that were completed; these cases include exact duplicates, near-duplicates, and even short overlaps. They showcase that it is difficult to find a single viable choice of $n$ for membership definitions. Using these insights, we design adversarial datasets that can cause a given target sequence to be completed without containing it, for any reasonable choice of $n$. Our findings highlight the inadequacy of $n$-gram membership, suggesting membership definitions fail to account for auxiliary information available to the training algorithm.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.17509	Follow-up Question Generation For Enhanced Patient-Provider Conversations	Joseph Gatto, Parker Seegmiller, Timothy Burdick, Inas S. Khayal, Sarah DeLozier, Sarah M. Preum	Follow-up question generation is an essential feature of dialogue systems as it can reduce conversational ambiguity and enhance modeling complex interactions. Conversational contexts often pose core NLP challenges such as (i) extracting relevant information buried in fragmented data sources, and (ii) modeling parallel thought processes. These two challenges occur frequently in medical dialogue as a doctor asks questions based not only on patient utterances but also their prior EHR data and current diagnostic hypotheses. Asking medical questions in asynchronous conversations compounds these issues as doctors can only rely on static EHR information to motivate follow-up questions.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18950	Target-Aware Video Diffusion Models	Taeksoo Kim, Hanbyul Joo	We present a target-aware video diffusion model that generates videos from an input image in which an actor interacts with a specified target while performing a desired action. The target is defined by a segmentation mask and the desired action is described via a text prompt. Unlike existing controllable image-to-video diffusion models that often rely on dense structural or motion cues to guide the actor's movements toward the target, our target-aware model requires only a simple mask to indicate the target, leveraging the generalization capabilities of pretrained models to produce plausible actions. This makes our method particularly effective for human-object interaction (HOI) scenarios, where providing precise action guidance is challenging, and further enables the use of video diffusion models for high-level action planning in applications such as robotics. We build our target-aware model by extending a baseline model to incorporate the target mask as an additional input. To enforce target awareness, we introduce a special token that encodes the target's spatial information within the text prompt. We then fine-tune the model with our curated dataset using a novel cross-attention loss that aligns the cross-attention maps associated with this token with the input target mask. To further improve performance, we selectively apply this loss to the most semantically relevant transformer blocks and attention regions. Experimental results show that our target-aware model outperforms existing solutions in generating videos where actors interact accurately with the specified targets. We further demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream applications: video content creation and zero-shot 3D HOI motion synthesis.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18948	Equivariant Image Modeling	Ruixiao Dong, Mengde Xu, Zigang Geng, Li Li, Han Hu, Shuyang Gu	Current generative models, such as autoregressive and diffusion approaches, decompose high-dimensional data distribution learning into a series of simpler subtasks. However, inherent conflicts arise during the joint optimization of these subtasks, and existing solutions fail to resolve such conflicts without sacrificing efficiency or scalability. We propose a novel equivariant image modeling framework that inherently aligns optimization targets across subtasks by leveraging the translation invariance of natural visual signals. Our method introduces (1) column-wise tokenization which enhances translational symmetry along the horizontal axis, and (2) windowed causal attention which enforces consistent contextual relationships across positions. Evaluated on class-conditioned ImageNet generation at 256x256 resolution, our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR models while using fewer computational resources. Systematic analysis demonstrates that enhanced equivariance reduces inter-task conflicts, significantly improving zero-shot generalization and enabling ultra-long image synthesis. This work establishes the first framework for task-aligned decomposition in generative modeling, offering insights into efficient parameter sharing and conflict-free optimization. The code and models are publicly available at this https URL.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18947	Tuning-Free Amodal Segmentation via the Occlusion-Free Bias of Inpainting Models	Jae Joong Lee, Bedrich Benes, Raymond A. Yeh	"Amodal segmentation aims to predict segmentation masks for both the visible and occluded regions of an object. Most existing works formulate this as a supervised learning problem, requiring manually annotated amodal masks or synthetic training data. Consequently, their performance depends on the quality of the datasets, which often lack diversity and scale. This work introduces a tuning-free approach that repurposes pretrained diffusion-based inpainting models for amodal segmentation. Our approach is motivated by the ""occlusion-free bias"" of inpainting models, i.e., the inpainted objects tend to be complete objects without occlusions. Specifically, we reconstruct the occluded regions of an object via inpainting and then apply segmentation, all without additional training or fine-tuning. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of our approach. On average, our approach achieves 5.3% more accurate masks over the state-of-the-art."

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18945	Aether: Geometric-Aware Unified World Modeling	Aether Team, Haoyi Zhu, Yifan Wang, Jianjun Zhou, Wenzheng Chang, Yang Zhou, Zizun Li, Junyi Chen, Chunhua Shen, Jiangmiao Pang, Tong He	The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a critical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial reasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video generation models, our framework demonstrates unprecedented synthetic-to-real generalization despite never observing real-world data during training. Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling. Remarkably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance far exceeds that of domain-specific models. Additionally, Aether leverages a geometry-informed action space to seamlessly translate predictions into actions, enabling effective autonomous trajectory planning. We hope our work inspires the community to explore new frontiers in physically-reasonable world modeling and its applications.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18944	DINO in the Room: Leveraging 2D Foundation Models for 3D Segmentation	Karim Abou Zeid, Kadir Yilmaz, Daan de Geus, Alexander Hermans, David Adrian, Timm Linder, Bastian Leibe	Vision foundation models (VFMs) trained on large-scale image datasets provide high-quality features that have significantly advanced 2D visual recognition. However, their potential in 3D vision remains largely untapped, despite the common availability of 2D images alongside 3D point cloud datasets. While significant research has been dedicated to 2D-3D fusion, recent state-of-the-art 3D methods predominantly focus on 3D data, leaving the integration of VFMs into 3D models underexplored. In this work, we challenge this trend by introducing DITR, a simple yet effective approach that extracts 2D foundation model features, projects them to 3D, and finally injects them into a 3D point cloud segmentation model. DITR achieves state-of-the-art results on both indoor and outdoor 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks. To enable the use of VFMs even when images are unavailable during inference, we further propose to distill 2D foundation models into a 3D backbone as a pretraining task. By initializing the 3D backbone with knowledge distilled from 2D VFMs, we create a strong basis for downstream 3D segmentation tasks, ultimately boosting performance across various datasets.

This model family employs the two-stream SlowFast mechanism, enabling efficient modeling of long-range temporal context to meet the demand for lightweight, mobile-friendly Video LLMs. We provide models ranging from 1B to 7B parameters, optimized through a streamlined training pipeline and a high-quality data mixture composed of publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SF-LLaVA-1.5 achieves competitive performance on a wide range of video and image benchmarks, with robust results across all model sizes. Notably, SF-LLaVA-1.5 achieves state-of-the-art results in long-form video understanding (e.g., LongVideoBench and MLVU) and excels at small scales (1B and 3B) across various video benchmarks.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18942	Video-T1: Test-Time Scaling for Video Generation	Fangfu Liu, Hanyang Wang, Yimo Cai, Kaiyan Zhang, Xiaohang Zhan, Yueqi Duan	With the scale capability of increasing training data, model size, and computational cost, video generation has achieved impressive results in digital creation, enabling users to express creativity across various domains. Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.

This computational burden primarily arises from the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to image or video resolution. While existing acceleration methods often compromise output quality or necessitate costly retraining, we observe that most diffusion models are pre-trained at lower resolutions, presenting an opportunity to exploit these low-resolution priors for more efficient inference without degrading performance. In this work, we introduce Bottleneck Sampling, a training-free framework that leverages low-resolution priors to reduce computational overhead while preserving output fidelity. Bottleneck Sampling follows a high-low-high denoising workflow: it performs high-resolution denoising in the initial and final stages while operating at lower resolutions in intermediate steps. To mitigate aliasing and blurring artifacts, we further refine the resolution transition points and adaptively shift the denoising timesteps at each stage. We evaluate Bottleneck Sampling on both image and video generation tasks, where extensive experiments demonstrate that it accelerates inference by up to 3$\times$ for image generation and 2.5$\times$ for video generation, all while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process across multiple evaluation metrics.

To address this limitation, we propose a multi-modal framework for Synchronous Video Prediction (SyncVP) that incorporates complementary data modalities, enhancing the richness and accuracy of future predictions. SyncVP builds on pre-trained modality-specific diffusion models and introduces an efficient spatio-temporal cross-attention module to enable effective information sharing across modalities. We evaluate SyncVP on standard benchmark datasets, such as Cityscapes and BAIR, using depth as an additional modality. We furthermore demonstrate its generalization to other modalities on SYNTHIA with semantic information and ERA5-Land with climate data. Notably, SyncVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in scenarios where only one modality is present, demonstrating its robustness and potential for a wide range of applications.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18931	CoMP: Continual Multimodal Pre-training for Vision Foundation Models	Yitong Chen, Lingchen Meng, Wujian Peng, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang	Pre-trained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong visual representations for a wide range of applications. In this paper, we continually pre-train prevailing VFMs in a multimodal manner such that they can effortlessly process visual inputs of varying sizes and produce visual representations that are more aligned with language representations, regardless of their original pre-training process. To this end, we introduce CoMP, a carefully designed multimodal pre-training pipeline. CoMP uses a Continual Rotary Position Embedding to support native resolution continual pre-training, and an Alignment Loss between visual and textual features through language prototypes to align multimodal representations. By three-stage training, our VFMs achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding but also in other downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. Remarkably, CoMP-SigLIP achieves scores of 66.7 on ChartQA and 75.9 on DocVQA with a 0.5B LLM, while maintaining an 87.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1K and a 49.5 mIoU on ADE20K under frozen chunk evaluation.

To address this gap, we introduce Video SimpleQA, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for factuality evaluation of LVLMs. Our work distinguishes from existing video benchmarks through the following key features: 1) Knowledge required: demanding integration of external knowledge beyond the explicit narrative; 2) Fact-seeking question: targeting objective, undisputed events or relationships, avoiding subjective interpretation; 3) Definitive & short-form answer: Answers are crafted as unambiguous and definitively correct in a short format, enabling automated evaluation through LLM-as-a-judge frameworks with minimal scoring variance; 4) External-source verified: All annotations undergo rigorous validation against authoritative external references to ensure the reliability; 5) Temporal reasoning required: The annotated question types encompass both static single-frame understanding and dynamic temporal reasoning, explicitly evaluating LVLMs factuality under the long-context dependencies. We extensively evaluate 41 state-of-the-art LVLMs and summarize key findings as follows: 1) Current LVLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in factual adherence, particularly for open-source models. The best-performing model Gemini-1.5-Pro achieves merely an F-score of 54.4%; 2) Test-time compute paradigms show insignificant performance gains, revealing fundamental constraints for enhancing factuality through post-hoc computation; 3) Retrieval-Augmented Generation demonstrates consistent improvements at the cost of additional inference time overhead, presenting a critical efficiency-performance trade-off.

However, real-world applications of SSOD often face critical challenges, including class imbalance, label noise, and labeling errors. We present an in-depth analysis of SSOD under real-world conditions, uncovering causes of suboptimal pseudo-labeling and key trade-offs between label quality and quantity. Based on our findings, we propose four building blocks that can be seamlessly integrated into an SSOD framework. Rare Class Collage (RCC): a data augmentation method that enhances the representation of rare classes by creating collages of rare objects. Rare Class Focus (RCF): a stratified batch sampling strategy that ensures a more balanced representation of all classes during training. Ground Truth Label Correction (GLC): a label refinement method that identifies and corrects false, missing, and noisy ground truth labels by leveraging the consistency of teacher model predictions. Pseudo-Label Selection (PLS): a selection method for removing low-quality pseudo-labeled images, guided by a novel metric estimating the missing detection rate while accounting for class rarity. We validate our methods through comprehensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets, resulting in up to 6% increase in SSOD performance. Overall, our investigation and novel, data-centric, and broadly applicable building blocks enable robust and effective SSOD in complex, real-world scenarios. Code is available at this https URL.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18897	Online 3D Scene Reconstruction Using Neural Object Priors	Thomas Chabal, Shizhe Chen, Jean Ponce, Cordelia Schmid	This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing a scene online at the level of objects given an RGB-D video sequence. While current object-aware neural implicit representations hold promise, they are limited in online reconstruction efficiency and shape completion. Our main contributions to alleviate the above limitations are twofold. First, we propose a feature grid interpolation mechanism to continuously update grid-based object-centric neural implicit representations as new object parts are revealed. Second, we construct an object library with previously mapped objects in advance and leverage the corresponding shape priors to initialize geometric object models in new videos, subsequently completing them with novel views as well as synthesized past views to avoid losing original object details. Extensive experiments on synthetic environments from the Replica dataset, real-world ScanNet sequences and videos captured in our laboratory demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art neural implicit models for this task in terms of reconstruction accuracy and completeness.

Yeh, Ziwei Liu	Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely adopted technique in diffusion/flow models to improve image fidelity and controllability. In this work, we first analytically study the effect of CFG on flow matching models trained on Gaussian mixtures where the ground-truth flow can be derived. We observe that in the early stages of training, when the flow estimation is inaccurate, CFG directs samples toward incorrect trajectories. Building on this observation, we propose CFG-Zero*, an improved CFG with two contributions: (a) optimized scale, where a scalar is optimized to correct for the inaccuracies in the estimated velocity, hence the * in the name; and (b) zero-init, which involves zeroing out the first few steps of the ODE solver. Experiments on both text-to-image (Lumina-Next, Stable Diffusion 3, and Flux) and text-to-video (Wan-2.1) generation demonstrate that CFG-Zero* consistently outperforms CFG, highlighting its effectiveness in guiding Flow Matching models.

However, the computational and memory demands of these models are significant, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained applications. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient and accurate STR system. Specifically, we focus on improving the efficiency of encoder models by introducing a cascaded-transformers structure. This structure progressively reduces the vision token size during the encoding step, effectively eliminating redundant tokens and reducing computational cost. Our experimental results confirm that our STR system achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines while substantially decreasing computational requirements. In particular, for large-models, the accuracy remains same, 92.77 to 92.68, while computational complexity is almost halved with our structure.

Existing approaches are typically limited to handling either speech or non-speech sounds independently, or at best, together but sequentially without mixing. This limitation prevents them from capturing the complexity of real-world audio sources that are often mixed. Our approach introduces a 'mix-and-separate' framework with audio-visual alignment objectives that jointly learn correspondence and disentanglement using mixed audio. Through these objectives, our model learns to produce distinct embeddings for each audio type, enabling effective disentanglement and grounding across mixed audio sources. Additionally, we created a new dataset to evaluate simultaneous grounding of mixed audio sources, demonstrating that our model outperforms prior methods. Our approach also achieves comparable or better performance in standard segmentation and cross-modal retrieval tasks, highlighting the benefits of our mix-and-separate approach.

Recent works on dataset distillation demonstrate that combining distilled and real data can mitigate the effectiveness decay. However, our analysis of the combination paradigm reveals that the current one-shot and independent selection mechanism induces an incompatibility issue between distilled and real images. To address this issue, we introduce a novel curriculum coarse-to-fine selection (CCFS) method for efficient high-IPC dataset distillation. CCFS employs a curriculum selection framework for real data selection, where we leverage a coarse-to-fine strategy to select appropriate real data based on the current synthetic dataset in each curriculum. Extensive experiments validate CCFS, surpassing the state-of-the-art by +6.6\% on CIFAR-10, +5.8\% on CIFAR-100, and +3.4\% on Tiny-ImageNet under high-IPC settings. Notably, CCFS achieves 60.2\% test accuracy on ResNet-18 with a 20\% compression ratio of Tiny-ImageNet, closely matching full-dataset training with only 0.3\% degradation. Code: this https URL.

While achieving excellent results in image classification and segmentation, Transformers remain inherently reliant on large training datasets and remain computationally expensive. A newly introduced Transformer derivative named KV Transformer shows promising results in synthetic, NLP, and image classification tasks, while reducing complexity and memory usage. This is especially conducive to use cases where local inference is required, such as medical screening applications. We endeavoured to further evaluate the merit of KV Transformers on semantic segmentation tasks, specifically in the domain of medical imaging. By directly comparing traditional and KV variants of the same base architectures, we provide further insight into the practical tradeoffs of reduced model complexity. We observe a notable reduction in parameter count and multiply accumulate operations, while achieving similar performance from most of the KV variant models when directly compared to their QKV implementation.

Given a single portrait image as an appearance reference and video clips as driving templates, HunyuanPortrait can animate the character in the reference image by the facial expression and head pose of the driving videos. In our framework, we utilize pre-trained encoders to achieve the decoupling of portrait motion information and identity in videos. To do so, implicit representation is adopted to encode motion information and is employed as control signals in the animation phase. By leveraging the power of stable video diffusion as the main building block, we carefully design adapter layers to inject control signals into the denoising unet through attention mechanisms. These bring spatial richness of details and temporal consistency. HunyuanPortrait also exhibits strong generalization performance, which can effectively disentangle appearance and motion under different image styles. Our framework outperforms existing methods, demonstrating superior temporal consistency and controllability. Our project is available at this https URL.

To enhance user experience, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, they mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits real-world applicability. This paper proposes the first multi-concept personalization paradigm, MC-LLaVA. Specifically, MC-LLaVA employs a multi-concept instruction tuning strategy, effectively integrating multiple concepts in a single training step. To reduce the costs related to joint training, we propose a personalized textual prompt that uses visual token information to initialize concept tokens. Additionally, we introduce a personalized visual prompt during inference, aggregating location confidence maps for enhanced recognition and grounding capabilities. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality instruction tuning dataset. We carefully collect images with multiple characters and objects from movies and manually generate question-answer samples for multi-concept scenarios, featuring superior diversity. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants.

Tan	3D texture swapping allows for the customization of 3D object textures, enabling efficient and versatile visual transformations in 3D editing. While no dedicated method exists, adapted 2D editing and text-driven 3D editing approaches can serve this purpose. However, 2D editing requires frame-by-frame manipulation, causing inconsistencies across views, while text-driven 3D editing struggles to preserve texture characteristics from reference images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce 3DSwapping, a 3D texture swapping method that integrates: 1) progressive generation, 2) view-consistency gradient guidance, and 3) prompt-tuned gradient guidance. To ensure view consistency, our progressive generation process starts by editing a single reference image and gradually propagates the edits to adjacent views. Our view-consistency gradient guidance further reinforces consistency by conditioning the generation model on feature differences between consistent and inconsistent outputs. To preserve texture characteristics, we introduce prompt-tuning-based gradient guidance, which learns a token that precisely captures the difference between the reference image and the 3D object. This token then guides the editing process, ensuring more consistent texture preservation across views. Overall, 3DSwapping integrates these novel strategies to achieve higher-fidelity texture transfer while preserving structural coherence across multiple viewpoints. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm that our three novel components enable convincing and effective 2D texture swapping for 3D objects. Code will be available upon acceptance.

Although existing gait recognition methods have achieved substantial success in controlled laboratory datasets, their performance often declines significantly when transitioning to wild this http URL argue that the performance gap can be primarily attributed to the spatio-temporal distribution inconsistencies present in wild datasets, where subjects appear at varying angles, positions, and distances across the frames. To achieve accurate gait recognition in the wild, we propose a skeleton-guided silhouette alignment strategy, which uses prior knowledge of the skeletons to perform affine transformations on the corresponding this http URL the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the impact of data alignment on gait recognition.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18817	Enhanced OoD Detection through Cross-Modal Alignment of Multi-Modal Representations	Jeonghyeon Kim, Sangheum Hwang	Prior research on out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) has primarily focused on single-modality models. Recently, with the advent of large-scale pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP, OoDD methods utilizing such multi-modal representations through zero-shot and prompt learning strategies have emerged. However, these methods typically involve either freezing the pretrained weights or only partially tuning them, which can be suboptimal for downstream datasets. In this paper, we highlight that multi-modal fine-tuning (MMFT) can achieve notable OoDD performance. Despite some recent works demonstrating the impact of fine-tuning methods for OoDD, there remains significant potential for performance improvement. We investigate the limitation of naÃ¯ve fine-tuning methods, examining why they fail to fully leverage the pretrained knowledge. Our empirical analysis suggests that this issue could stem from the modality gap within in-distribution (ID) embeddings. To address this, we propose a training objective that enhances cross-modal alignment by regularizing the distances between image and text embeddings of ID data. This adjustment helps in better utilizing pretrained textual information by aligning similar semantics from different modalities (i.e., text and image) more closely in the hyperspherical representation space. We theoretically demonstrate that the proposed regularization corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimation of an energy-based model on a hypersphere. Utilizing ImageNet-1k OoD benchmark datasets, we show that our method, combined with post-hoc OoDD approaches leveraging pretrained knowledge (e.g., NegLabel), significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art OoDD performance and leading ID accuracy.

We employ perturbation techniques like flipping, rotation, Gaussian noise injection, and JPEG compression during training to improve model robustness and generalisation. The experimental results demonstrate that our ViT-based pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming competing methods on both validation and test datasets.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18808	CRCL: Causal Representation Consistency Learning for Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos	Yang Liu, Hongjin Wang, Zepu Wang, Xiaoguang Zhu, Jing Liu, Peng Sun, Rui Tang, Jianwei Du, Victor C.M. Leung, Liang Song	Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) remains a fundamental yet formidable task in the video understanding community, with promising applications in areas such as information forensics and public safety protection. Due to the rarity and diversity of anomalies, existing methods only use easily collected regular events to model the inherent normality of normal spatial-temporal patterns in an unsupervised manner. Previous studies have shown that existing unsupervised VAD models are incapable of label-independent data offsets (e.g., scene changes) in real-world scenarios and may fail to respond to light anomalies due to the overgeneralization of deep neural networks. Inspired by causality learning, we argue that there exist causal factors that can adequately generalize the prototypical patterns of regular events and present significant deviations when anomalous instances occur. In this regard, we propose Causal Representation Consistency Learning (CRCL) to implicitly mine potential scene-robust causal variable in unsupervised video normality learning. Specifically, building on the structural causal models, we propose scene-debiasing learning and causality-inspired normality learning to strip away entangled scene bias in deep representations and learn causal video normality, respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over conventional deep representation learning. Moreover, ablation studies and extension validation show that the CRCL can cope with label-independent biases in multi-scene settings and maintain stable performance with only limited training data available.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18803	Change3D: Revisiting Change Detection and Captioning from A Video Modeling Perspective	Duowang Zhu, Xiaohu Huang, Haiyan Huang, Hao Zhou, Zhenfeng Shao	In this paper, we present Change3D, a framework that reconceptualizes the change detection and captioning tasks through video modeling. Recent methods have achieved remarkable success by regarding each pair of bi-temporal images as separate frames. They employ a shared-weight image encoder to extract spatial features and then use a change extractor to capture differences between the two images. However, image feature encoding, being a task-agnostic process, cannot attend to changed regions effectively. Furthermore, different change extractors designed for various change detection and captioning tasks make it difficult to have a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, Change3D regards the bi-temporal images as comprising two frames akin to a tiny video. By integrating learnable perception frames between the bi-temporal images, a video encoder enables the perception frames to interact with the images directly and perceive their differences. Therefore, we can get rid of the intricate change extractors, providing a unified framework for different change detection and captioning tasks. We verify Change3D on multiple tasks, encompassing change detection (including binary change detection, semantic change detection, and building damage assessment) and change captioning, across eight standard benchmarks. Without bells and whistles, this simple yet effective framework can achieve superior performance with an ultra-light video model comprising only ~6%-13% of the parameters and ~8%-34% of the FLOPs compared to state-of-the-art methods. We hope that Change3D could be an alternative to 2D-based models and facilitate future research.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18794	NexusGS: Sparse View Synthesis with Epipolar Depth Priors in 3D Gaussian Splatting	Yulong Zheng, Zicheng Jiang, Shengfeng He, Yandu Sun, Junyu Dong, Huaidong Zhang, Yong Du	Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have noticeably advanced photo-realistic novel view synthesis using images from densely spaced camera viewpoints. However, these methods struggle in few-shot scenarios due to limited supervision. In this paper, we present NexusGS, a 3DGS-based approach that enhances novel view synthesis from sparse-view images by directly embedding depth information into point clouds, without relying on complex manual regularizations. Exploiting the inherent epipolar geometry of 3DGS, our method introduces a novel point cloud densification strategy that initializes 3DGS with a dense point cloud, reducing randomness in point placement while preventing over-smoothing and overfitting. Specifically, NexusGS comprises three key steps: Epipolar Depth Nexus, Flow-Resilient Depth Blending, and Flow-Filtered Depth Pruning. These steps leverage optical flow and camera poses to compute accurate depth maps, while mitigating the inaccuracies often associated with optical flow. By incorporating epipolar depth priors, NexusGS ensures reliable dense point cloud coverage and supports stable 3DGS training under sparse-view conditions. Experiments demonstrate that NexusGS significantly enhances depth accuracy and rendering quality, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. Furthermore, we validate the superiority of our generated point clouds by substantially boosting the performance of competing methods. Project page: this https URL.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18785	LGI-DETR: Local-Global Interaction for UAV Object Detection	Zifa Chen	UAV has been widely used in various fields. However, most of the existing object detectors used in drones are not end-to-end and require the design of various complex components and careful fine-tuning. Most of the existing end-to-end object detectors are designed for natural scenes. It is not ideal to apply them directly to UAV images. In order to solve the above challenges, we design an local-global information interaction DETR for UAVs, namely LGI-DETR. Cross-layer bidirectional low-level and high-level feature information enhancement, this fusion method is effective especially in the field of small objection detection. At the initial stage of encoder, we propose a local spatial enhancement module (LSE), which enhances the low-level rich local spatial information into the high-level feature, and reduces the loss of local information in the transmission process of high-level information. At the final stage of the encoder, we propose a novel global information injection module (GII) designed to integrate rich high-level global semantic representations with low-level feature maps. This hierarchical fusion mechanism effectively addresses the inherent limitations of local receptive fields by propagating contextual information across the feature hierarchy. Experimental results on two challenging UAV image object detection benchmarks, VisDrone2019 and UAVDT, show that our proposed model outperforms the SOTA model. Compared to the baseline model, AP and AP50 improved by 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18784	Leveraging Perturbation Robustness to Enhance Out-of-Distribution Detection	Wenxi Chen, Raymond A. Yeh, Shaoshuai Mou, Yan Gu	Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is the task of identifying inputs that deviate from the training data distribution. This capability is essential for safely deploying deep computer vision models in open-world environments. In this work, we propose a post-hoc method, Perturbation-Rectified OOD detection (PRO), based on the insight that prediction confidence for OOD inputs is more susceptible to reduction under perturbation than in-distribution (IND) inputs. Based on the observation, we propose an adversarial score function that searches for the local minimum scores near the original inputs by applying gradient descent. This procedure enhances the separability between IND and OOD samples. Importantly, the approach improves OOD detection performance without complex modifications to the underlying model architectures. We conduct extensive experiments using the OpenOOD benchmark~\cite{yang2022openood}. Our approach further pushes the limit of softmax-based OOD detection and is the leading post-hoc method for small-scale models. On a CIFAR-10 model with adversarial training, PRO effectively detects near-OOD inputs, achieving a reduction of more than 10\% on FPR@95 compared to state-of-the-art methods.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18783	Frequency Dynamic Convolution for Dense Image Prediction	Linwei Chen, Lin Gu, Liang Li, Chenggang Yan, Ying Fu	While Dynamic Convolution (DY-Conv) has shown promising performance by enabling adaptive weight selection through multiple parallel weights combined with an attention mechanism, the frequency response of these weights tends to exhibit high similarity, resulting in high parameter costs but limited adaptability. In this work, we introduce Frequency Dynamic Convolution (FDConv), a novel approach that mitigates these limitations by learning a fixed parameter budget in the Fourier domain. FDConv divides this budget into frequency-based groups with disjoint Fourier indices, enabling the construction of frequency-diverse weights without increasing the parameter cost. To further enhance adaptability, we propose Kernel Spatial Modulation (KSM) and Frequency Band Modulation (FBM). KSM dynamically adjusts the frequency response of each filter at the spatial level, while FBM decomposes weights into distinct frequency bands in the frequency domain and modulates them dynamically based on local content. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, and classification validate the effectiveness of FDConv. We demonstrate that when applied to ResNet-50, FDConv achieves superior performance with a modest increase of +3.6M parameters, outperforming previous methods that require substantial increases in parameter budgets (e.g., CondConv +90M, KW +76.5M). Moreover, FDConv seamlessly integrates into a variety of architectures, including ConvNeXt, Swin-Transformer, offering a flexible and efficient solution for modern vision tasks.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18767	Good Keypoints for the Two-View Geometry Estimation Problem	Konstantin Pakulev, Alexander Vakhitov, Gonzalo Ferrer	Local features are essential to many modern downstream applications. Therefore, it is of interest to determine the properties of local features that contribute to the downstream performance for a better design of feature detectors and descriptors. In our work, we propose a new theoretical model for scoring feature points (keypoints) in the context of the two-view geometry estimation problem. The model determines two properties that a good keypoint for solving the homography estimation problem should have: be repeatable and have a small expected measurement error. This result provides key insights into why maximizing the number of correspondences doesn't always lead to better homography estimation accuracy. We use the developed model to design a method that detects keypoints that benefit the homography estimation introducing the Bounded NeSS-ST (BoNeSS-ST) keypoint detector. The novelty of BoNeSS-ST comes from strong theoretical foundations, a more accurate keypoint scoring due to subpixel refinement and a cost designed for superior robustness to low saliency keypoints. As a result, BoNeSS-ST outperforms prior self-supervised local feature detectors in both planar homography and epipolar geometry estimation problems.

A detailed, pixel-level understanding of hands and surgical tools is crucial for interpreting a surgeon's actions and intentions.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18753	Self-Supervised Learning based on Transformed Image Reconstruction for Equivariance-Coherent Feature Representation	Qin Wang, Benjamin Bruns, Hanno Scharr, Kai Krajsek	The equivariant behaviour of features is essential in many computer vision tasks, yet popular self-supervised learning (SSL) methods tend to constrain equivariance by design. We propose a self-supervised learning approach where the system learns transformations independently by reconstructing images that have undergone previously unseen transformations. Specifically, the model is tasked to reconstruct intermediate transformed images, e.g. translated or rotated images, without prior knowledge of these transformations. This auxiliary task encourages the model to develop equivariance-coherent features without relying on predefined transformation rules. To this end, we apply transformations to the input image, generating an image pair, and then split the extracted features into two sets per image. One set is used with a usual SSL loss encouraging invariance, the other with our loss based on the auxiliary task to reconstruct the intermediate transformed images. Our loss and the SSL loss are linearly combined with weighted terms. Evaluating on synthetic tasks with natural images, our proposed method strongly outperforms all competitors, regardless of whether they are designed to learn equivariance. Furthermore, when trained alongside augmentation-based methods as the invariance tasks, such as iBOT or DINOv2, we successfully learn a balanced combination of invariant and equivariant features. Our approach performs strong on a rich set of realistic computer vision downstream tasks, almost always improving over all baselines.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18746	Linguistics-aware Masked Image Modeling for Self-supervised Scene Text Recognition	Yifei Zhang, Chang Liu, Jin Wei, Xiaomeng Yang, Yu Zhou, Can Ma, Xiangyang Ji	Text images are unique in their dual nature, encompassing both visual and linguistic information. The visual component encompasses structural and appearance-based features, while the linguistic dimension incorporates contextual and semantic elements. In scenarios with degraded visual quality, linguistic patterns serve as crucial supplements for comprehension, highlighting the necessity of integrating both aspects for robust scene text recognition (STR). Contemporary STR approaches often use language models or semantic reasoning modules to capture linguistic features, typically requiring large-scale annotated datasets. Self-supervised learning, which lacks annotations, presents challenges in disentangling linguistic features related to the global context. Typically, sequence contrastive learning emphasizes the alignment of local features, while masked image modeling (MIM) tends to exploit local structures to reconstruct visual patterns, resulting in limited linguistic knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Linguistics-aware Masked Image Modeling (LMIM) approach, which channels the linguistic information into the decoding process of MIM through a separate branch. Specifically, we design a linguistics alignment module to extract vision-independent features as linguistic guidance using inputs with different visual appearances. As features extend beyond mere visual structures, LMIM must consider the global context to achieve reconstruction. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks quantitatively demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, and attention visualizations qualitatively show the simultaneous capture of both visual and linguistic information.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18742	SFDLA: Source-Free Document Layout Analysis	Sebastian Tewes, Yufan Chen, Omar Moured, Jiaming Zhang, Rainer Stiefelhagen	Document Layout Analysis (DLA) is a fundamental task in document understanding. However, existing DLA and adaptation methods often require access to large-scale source data and target labels. This requirements severely limiting their real-world applicability, particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained domains, such as financial statements, medical records, and proprietary business documents. According to our observation, directly transferring source-domain fine-tuned models on target domains often results in a significant performance drop (Avg. -32.64%). In this work, we introduce Source-Free Document Layout Analysis (SFDLA), aiming for adapting a pre-trained source DLA models to an unlabeled target domain, without access to any source data. To address this challenge, we establish the first SFDLA benchmark, covering three major DLA datasets for geometric- and content-aware adaptation. Furthermore, we propose Document Layout Analysis Adapter (DLAdapter), a novel framework that is designed to improve source-free adaptation across document domains. Our method achieves a +4.21% improvement over the source-only baseline and a +2.26% gain over existing source-free methods from PubLayNet to DocLayNet. We believe this work will inspire the DLA community to further investigate source-free document understanding.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18725	FG$^2$: Fine-Grained Cross-View Localization by Fine-Grained Feature Matching	Zimin Xia, Alexandre Alahi	We propose a novel fine-grained cross-view localization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom pose of a ground-level image in an aerial image of the surroundings by matching fine-grained features between the two images. The pose is estimated by aligning a point plane generated from the ground image with a point plane sampled from the aerial image. To generate the ground points, we first map ground image features to a 3D point cloud. Our method then learns to select features along the height dimension to pool the 3D points to a Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) plane. This selection enables us to trace which feature in the ground image contributes to the BEV representation. Next, we sample a set of sparse matches from computed point correspondences between the two point planes and compute their relative pose using Procrustes alignment. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art, our method reduces the mean localization error by 28% on the VIGOR cross-area test set. Qualitative results show that our method learns semantically consistent matches across ground and aerial views through weakly supervised learning from the camera pose.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18719	Boosting Resolution Generalization of Diffusion Transformers with Randomized Positional Encodings	Cong Liu, Liang Hou, Mingwu Zheng, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Kun Gai	Resolution generalization in image generation tasks enables the production of higher-resolution images with lower training resolution overhead. However, a significant challenge in resolution generalization, particularly in the widely used Diffusion Transformers, lies in the mismatch between the positional encodings encountered during testing and those used during training. While existing methods have employed techniques such as interpolation, extrapolation, or their combinations, none have fully resolved this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel two-dimensional randomized positional encodings (RPE-2D) framework that focuses on learning positional order of image patches instead of the specific distances between them, enabling seamless high- and low-resolution image generation without requiring high- and low-resolution image training. Specifically, RPE-2D independently selects positions over a broader range along both the horizontal and vertical axes, ensuring that all position encodings are trained during the inference phase, thus improving resolution generalization. Additionally, we propose a random data augmentation technique to enhance the modeling of position order. To address the issue of image cropping caused by the augmentation, we introduce corresponding micro-conditioning to enable the model to perceive the specific cropping patterns. On the ImageNet dataset, our proposed RPE-2D achieves state-of-the-art resolution generalization performance, outperforming existing competitive methods when trained at a resolution of $256 \times 256$ and inferred at $384 \times 384$ and $512 \times 512$, as well as when scaling from $512 \times 512$ to $768 \times 768$ and $1024 \times 1024$. And it also exhibits outstanding capabilities in low-resolution image generation, multi-stage training acceleration and multi-resolution inheritance.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18718	GS-Marker: Generalizable and Robust Watermarking for 3D Gaussian Splatting	Lijiang Li, Jinglu Wang, Xiang Ming, Yan Lu	In the Generative AI era, safeguarding 3D models has become increasingly urgent. While invisible watermarking is well-established for 2D images with encoder-decoder frameworks, generalizable and robust solutions for 3D remain elusive. The main difficulty arises from the renderer between the 3D encoder and 2D decoder, which disrupts direct gradient flow and complicates training. Existing 3D methods typically rely on per-scene iterative optimization, resulting in time inefficiency and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a single-pass watermarking approach for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a well-known yet underexplored representation for watermarking. We identify two major challenges: (1) ensuring effective training generalized across diverse 3D models, and (2) reliably extracting watermarks from free-view renderings, even under distortions. Our framework, named GS-Marker, incorporates a 3D encoder to embed messages, distortion layers to enhance resilience against various distortions, and a 2D decoder to extract watermarks from renderings. A key innovation is the Adaptive Marker Control mechanism that adaptively perturbs the initially optimized 3DGS, escaping local minima and improving both training stability and convergence. Extensive experiments show that GS-Marker outperforms per-scene training approaches in terms of decoding accuracy and model fidelity, while also significantly reducing computation time.

Mathis	Understanding human behavior requires measuring behavioral actions. Due to its complexity, behavior is best mapped onto a rich, semantic structure such as language. The recent development of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) is a promising candidate for a wide range of action understanding tasks. In this work, we focus on evaluating and then improving MLLMs to perform action recognition. We reformulate EPIC-KITCHENS-100, one of the largest and most challenging egocentric action datasets, to the form of video multiple question answering (EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA). We show that when we sample difficult incorrect answers as distractors, leading MLLMs struggle to recognize the correct actions. We propose a series of methods that greatly improve the MLLMs' ability to perform action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art on both the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 validation set, as well as outperforming GPT-4o by 21 points in accuracy on EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA. Lastly, we show improvements on other action-related video benchmarks such as EgoSchema, PerceptionTest, LongVideoBench, VideoMME and MVBench, suggesting that MLLMs are a promising path forward for complex action tasks.

Koelzer, Pascal Frossard, Gabriele Campanella, Gunnar RÃ¤tsch	Vision foundation models (FMs) are accelerating the development of digital pathology algorithms and transforming biomedical research. These models learn, in a self-supervised manner, to represent histological features in highly heterogeneous tiles extracted from whole-slide images (WSIs) of real-world patient samples. The performance of these FMs is significantly influenced by the size, diversity, and balance of the pre-training data. However, data selection has been primarily guided by expert knowledge at the WSI level, focusing on factors such as disease classification and tissue types, while largely overlooking the granular details available at the tile level. In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised automatic data curation at the tile-level, taking into account 350 million tiles. Specifically, we apply hierarchical clustering trees to pre-extracted tile embeddings, allowing us to sample balanced datasets uniformly across the embedding space of the pretrained FM. We further identify these datasets are subject to a trade-off between size and balance, potentially compromising the quality of representations learned by FMs, and propose tailored batch sampling strategies to mitigate this effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through improved performance on a diverse range of clinically relevant downstream tasks.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	24/03/2025

Kim	Snapshot polarization imaging calculates polarization states from linearly polarized subimages. To achieve this, a polarization camera employs a double Bayer-patterned sensor to capture both color and polarization. It demonstrates low light efficiency and low spatial resolution, resulting in increased noise and compromised polarization measurements. Although burst super-resolution effectively reduces noise and enhances spatial resolution, applying it to polarization imaging poses challenges due to the lack of tailored datasets and reliable ground truth noise statistics. To address these issues, we introduce PolarNS and PolarBurstSR, two innovative datasets developed specifically for polarization imaging. PolarNS provides characterization of polarization noise statistics, facilitating thorough analysis, while PolarBurstSR functions as a benchmark for burst super-resolution in polarization images. These datasets, collected under various real-world conditions, enable comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, we present a model for analyzing polarization noise to quantify noise propagation, tested on a large dataset captured in a darkroom environment. As part of our application, we compare the latest burst super-resolution models, highlighting the advantages of training tailored to polarization compared to RGB-based methods. This work establishes a benchmark for polarization burst super-resolution and offers critical insights into noise propagation, thereby enhancing polarization image reconstruction.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18703	Channel Consistency Prior and Self-Reconstruction Strategy Based Unsupervised Image Deraining	Guanglu Dong, Tianheng Zheng, Yuanzhouhan Cao, Linbo Qing, Chao Ren	Recently, deep image deraining models based on paired datasets have made a series of remarkable progress. However, they cannot be well applied in real-world applications due to the difficulty of obtaining real paired datasets and the poor generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Channel Consistency Prior and Self-Reconstruction Strategy Based Unsupervised Image Deraining framework, CSUD, to tackle the aforementioned challenges. During training with unpaired data, CSUD is capable of generating high-quality pseudo clean and rainy image pairs which are used to enhance the performance of deraining network. Specifically, to preserve more image background details while transferring rain streaks from rainy images to the unpaired clean images, we propose a novel Channel Consistency Loss (CCLoss) by introducing the Channel Consistency Prior (CCP) of rain streaks into training process, thereby ensuring that the generated pseudo rainy images closely resemble the real ones. Furthermore, we propose a novel Self-Reconstruction (SR) strategy to alleviate the redundant information transfer problem of the generator, further improving the deraining performance and the generalization capability of our method. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the deraining performance of CSUD surpasses other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and CSUD exhibits superior generalization capability.

On the other hand, most domain generalization or adversarial fine-tuning methods are task-related or model-specific, ignoring the universality in practical applications and the transferability between FMs. This paper delves into the problem of generalizing FMs to the out-of-domain data. We propose a novel framework, the Object-Concept-Relation Triad (OCRT), that enables FMs to extract sparse, high-level concepts and intricate relational structures from raw visual inputs. The key idea is to bind objects in visual scenes and a set of object-centric representations through unsupervised decoupling and iterative refinement. To be specific, we project the object-centric representations onto a semantic concept space that the model can readily interpret and estimate their importance to filter out irrelevant elements. Then, a concept-based graph, which has a flexible degree, is constructed to incorporate the set of concepts and their corresponding importance, enabling the extraction of high-order factors from informative concepts and facilitating relational reasoning among these concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCRT can substantially boost the generalizability and robustness of SAM and CLIP across multiple downstream tasks.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18682	Hardware-Rasterized Ray-Based Gaussian Splatting	Samuel Rota BulÃ², Nemanja Bartolovic, Lorenzo Porzi, Peter Kontschieder	We present a novel, hardware rasterized rendering approach for ray-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (RayGS), obtaining both fast and high-quality results for novel view synthesis. Our work contains a mathematically rigorous and geometrically intuitive derivation about how to efficiently estimate all relevant quantities for rendering RayGS models, structured with respect to standard hardware rasterization shaders. Our solution is the first enabling rendering RayGS models at sufficiently high frame rates to support quality-sensitive applications like Virtual and Mixed Reality. Our second contribution enables alias-free rendering for RayGS, by addressing MIP-related issues arising when rendering diverging scales during training and testing. We demonstrate significant performance gains, across different benchmark scenes, while retaining state-of-the-art appearance quality of RayGS.

However, existing proactive perturbation approaches remain unsatisfactory in several aspects: 1) visual degradation due to direct element-wise addition; 2) limited effectiveness against face swapping manipulation; 3) unavoidable reliance on white- and grey-box settings to involve generative models during training. In this study, we analyze the essence of Deepfake face swapping and argue the necessity of protecting source identities rather than target images, and we propose NullSwap, a novel proactive defense approach that cloaks source image identities and nullifies face swapping under a pure black-box scenario. We design an Identity Extraction module to obtain facial identity features from the source image, while a Perturbation Block is then devised to generate identity-guided perturbations accordingly. Meanwhile, a Feature Block extracts shallow-level image features, which are then fused with the perturbation in the Cloaking Block for image reconstruction. Furthermore, to ensure adaptability across different identity extractors in face swapping algorithms, we propose Dynamic Loss Weighting to adaptively balance identity losses. Experiments demonstrate the outstanding ability of our approach to fool various identity recognition models, outperforming state-of-the-art proactive perturbations in preventing face swapping models from generating images with correct source identities.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18674	Human Motion Unlearning	Edoardo De Matteis, Matteo Migliarini, Alessio Sampieri, Indro Spinelli, Fabio Galasso	"We introduce the task of human motion unlearning to prevent the synthesis of toxic animations while preserving the general text-to-motion generative performance. Unlearning toxic motions is challenging as those can be generated from explicit text prompts and from implicit toxic combinations of safe motions (e.g., ``kicking"" is ``loading and swinging a leg""). We propose the first motion unlearning benchmark by filtering toxic motions from the large and recent text-to-motion datasets of HumanML3D and Motion-X. We propose baselines, by adapting state-of-the-art image unlearning techniques to process spatio-temporal signals. Finally, we propose a novel motion unlearning model based on Latent Code Replacement, which we dub LCR. LCR is training-free and suitable to the discrete latent spaces of state-of-the-art text-to-motion diffusion models. LCR is simple and consistently outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. Project page: \href{this https URL}{this https URL}."	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	24/03/2025

Unlike existing methods that rely on textured 3D models or multiple viewpoints, Any6D leverages a joint object alignment process to enhance 2D-3D alignment and metric scale estimation for improved pose accuracy. Our approach integrates a render-and-compare strategy to generate and refine pose hypotheses, enabling robust performance in scenarios with occlusions, non-overlapping views, diverse lighting conditions, and large cross-environment variations. We evaluate our method on five challenging datasets: REAL275, Toyota-Light, HO3D, YCBINEOAT, and LM-O, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods for novel object pose estimation.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18672	Feature Calibration enhanced Parameter Synthesis for CLIP-based Class-incremental Learning	Juncen Guo, Xiaoguang Zhu, Lianlong Sun, Liangyu Teng, Di Li, Yang Liu, Liang Song	Class-incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new class knowledge while memorizing previous classes, facilitating their adaptation and evolution in dynamic environments. Traditional CIL methods are mainly based on visual features, which limits their ability to handle complex scenarios. In contrast, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promising potential to promote CIL by integrating pretrained knowledge with textual features. However, previous methods make it difficult to overcome catastrophic forgetting while preserving the generalization capabilities of VLMs. To tackle these challenges, we propose Feature Calibration enhanced Parameter Synthesis (FCPS) in this paper. Specifically, our FCPS employs a specific parameter adjustment mechanism to iteratively refine the proportion of original visual features participating in the final class determination, ensuring the model's foundational generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, parameter integration across different tasks achieves a balance between learning new class knowledge and retaining old knowledge. Experimental results on popular benchmarks (e.g., CIFAR100 and ImageNet100) validate the superiority of the proposed method.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18671	Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning for Relative Pose Estimation	Yihan Chen, Wenfei Yang, Huan Ren, Shifeng Zhang, Tianzhu Zhang, Feng Wu	Relative pose estimation provides a promising way for achieving object-agnostic pose estimation. Despite the success of existing 3D correspondence-based methods, the reliance on explicit feature matching suffers from small overlaps in visible regions and unreliable feature estimation for invisible regions. Inspired by humans' ability to assemble two object parts that have small or no overlapping regions by considering object structure, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Correspondence Learning method for Relative Pose Estimation, which consists of two key modules. First, a structure-aware keypoint extraction module is designed to locate a set of kepoints that can represent the structure of objects with different shapes and appearance, under the guidance of a keypoint based image reconstruction loss. Second, a structure-aware correspondence estimation module is designed to model the intra-image and inter-image relationships between keypoints to extract structure-aware features for correspondence estimation. By jointly leveraging these two modules, the proposed method can naturally estimate 3D-3D correspondences for unseen objects without explicit feature matching for precise relative pose estimation. Experimental results on the CO3D, Objaverse and LineMOD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms prior methods, i.e., with 5.7Â°reduction in mean angular error on the CO3D dataset.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18665	Boosting Virtual Agent Learning and Reasoning: A Step-wise, Multi-dimensional, and Generalist Reward Model with Benchmark	Bingchen Miao, Yang Wu, Minghe Gao, Qifan Yu, Wendong Bu, Wenqiao Zhang, Yunfei Li, Siliang Tang, Tat-Seng Chua, Juncheng Li	The development of Generalist Virtual Agents (GVAs) powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has shown significant promise in autonomous task execution. However, current training paradigms face critical limitations, including reliance on outcome supervision and labor-intensive human annotations. To address these challenges, we propose Similar, a Step-wise Multi-dimensional Generalist Reward Model, which offers fine-grained signals for agent training and can choose better action for inference-time scaling. Specifically, we begin by systematically defining five dimensions for evaluating agent actions. Building on this framework, we design an MCTS-P algorithm to automatically collect and annotate step-wise, five-dimensional agent execution data. Using this data, we train Similar with the Triple-M strategy. Furthermore, we introduce the first benchmark in the virtual agent domain for step-wise, multi-dimensional reward model training and evaluation, named SRM. This benchmark consists of two components: SRMTrain, which serves as the training set for Similar, and SRMEval, a manually selected test set for evaluating the reward model. Experimental results demonstrate that Similar, through its step-wise, multi-dimensional assessment and synergistic gain, provides GVAs with effective intermediate signals during both training and inference-time scaling.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18658	Leveraging Land Cover Priors for Isoprene Emission Super-Resolution	Christopher Ummerle, Antonio Giganti, Sara Mandelli, Paolo Bestagini, Stefano Tubaro	Remote sensing plays a crucial role in monitoring Earth's ecosystems, yet satellite-derived data often suffer from limited spatial resolution, restricting their applicability in atmospheric modeling and climate research. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based Super-Resolution (SR) framework that leverages land cover information to enhance the spatial accuracy of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) emissions, with a particular focus on isoprene. Our approach integrates land cover priors as emission drivers, capturing spatial patterns more effectively than traditional methods. We evaluate the model's performance across various climate conditions and analyze statistical correlations between isoprene emissions and key environmental information such as cropland and tree cover data. Additionally, we assess the generalization capabilities of our SR model by applying it to unseen climate zones and geographical regions. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating land cover data significantly improves emission SR accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous landscapes. This study contributes to atmospheric chemistry and climate modeling by providing a cost-effective, data-driven approach to refining BVOC emission maps. The proposed method enhances the usability of satellite-based emissions data, supporting applications in air quality forecasting, climate impact assessments, and environmental studies.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18652	Robust face recognition based on the wing loss and the $\ell_1$ regularization	Yaoyao Yun, Jianwen Xu	In recent years, sparse sampling techniques based on regression analysis have witnessed extensive applications in face recognition research. Presently, numerous sparse sampling models based on regression analysis have been explored by various researchers. Nevertheless, the recognition rates of the majority of these models would be significantly decreased when confronted with highly occluded and highly damaged face images. In this paper, a new wing-constrained sparse coding model(WCSC) and its weighted version(WWCSC) are introduced, so as to deal with the face recognition problem in complex circumstances, where the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is employed to solve the corresponding minimization problems. In addition, performances of the proposed method are examined based on the four well-known facial databases, namely the ORL facial database, the Yale facial database, the AR facial database and the FERET facial database. Also, compared to the other methods in the literatures, the WWCSC has a very high recognition rate even in complex situations where face images have high occlusion or high damage, which illustrates the robustness of the WWCSC method in facial recognition.

Simply using enhanced images as inputs would lead to issues with multi-view consistency, and current single-view enhancement systems rely on pre-trained data, lacking scene generalization. These problems limit the application of 3D Gaussian Splatting in low-light conditions in the field of robotics, including high-fidelity modeling and feature matching. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised multi-view stereoscopic system based on Gaussian Splatting, called Low-Light Gaussian Splatting (LLGS). This system aims to enhance images in low-light environments while reconstructing the scene. Our method introduces a decomposable Gaussian representation called M-Color, which separately characterizes color information for targeted enhancement. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised optimization method with zero-knowledge priors, using direction-based enhancement to ensure multi-view consistency. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both low-light enhancement and 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Namely, we tackle the problem that current video benchmarks may suffer from different representation biases, e.g., object bias or single-frame bias, where mere recognition of objects or utilization of only a single frame is sufficient for correct prediction. We leverage VLMs and LLMs to analyze and debias benchmarks from such representation biases. Specifically, we generate frame-wise textual descriptions of videos, filter them for specific information (e.g. only objects) and leverage them to examine representation biases across three dimensions: 1) concept bias - determining if a specific concept (e.g., objects) alone suffice for prediction; 2) temporal bias - assessing if temporal information contributes to prediction; and 3) common sense vs. dataset bias - evaluating whether zero-shot reasoning or dataset correlations contribute to prediction. We conduct a systematic analysis of 12 popular video classification and retrieval datasets and create new object-debiased test splits for these datasets. Moreover, we benchmark 30 state-of-the-art video models on original and debiased splits and analyze biases in the models. To facilitate the future development of more robust video understanding benchmarks and models, we release: ""UTD-descriptions"", a dataset with our rich structured descriptions for each dataset, and ""UTD-splits"", a dataset of object-debiased test splits."

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18635	OCCO: LVM-guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Framework based on Object-aware and Contextual COntrastive Learning	Hui Li, Congcong Bian, Zeyang Zhang, Xiaoning Song, Xi Li, Xiao-Jun Wu	Image fusion is a crucial technique in the field of computer vision, and its goal is to generate high-quality fused images and improve the performance of downstream tasks. However, existing fusion methods struggle to balance these two factors. Achieving high quality in fused images may result in lower performance in downstream visual tasks, and vice versa. To address this drawback, a novel LVM (large vision model)-guided fusion framework with Object-aware and Contextual COntrastive learning is proposed, termed as OCCO. The pre-trained LVM is utilized to provide semantic guidance, allowing the network to focus solely on fusion tasks while emphasizing learning salient semantic features in form of contrastive learning. Additionally, a novel feature interaction fusion network is also designed to resolve information conflicts in fusion images caused by modality differences. By learning the distinction between positive samples and negative samples in the latent feature space (contextual space), the integrity of target information in fused image is improved, thereby benefiting downstream performance. Finally, compared with eight state-of-the-art methods on four datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated, and exceptional performance is also demonstrated on downstream visual task.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18631	Robust Lane Detection with Wavelet-Enhanced Context Modeling and Adaptive Sampling	Kunyang Li, Ming Hou	Lane detection is critical for autonomous driving and ad-vanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). While recent methods like CLRNet achieve strong performance, they struggle under adverse con-ditions such as extreme weather, illumination changes, occlusions, and complex curves. We propose a Wavelet-Enhanced Feature Pyramid Net-work (WE-FPN) to address these challenges. A wavelet-based non-local block is integrated before the feature pyramid to improve global context modeling, especially for occluded and curved lanes. Additionally, we de-sign an adaptive preprocessing module to enhance lane visibility under poor lighting. An attention-guided sampling strategy further reffnes spa-tial features, boosting accuracy on distant and curved lanes. Experiments on CULane and TuSimple demonstrate that our approach signiffcantly outperforms baselines in challenging scenarios, achieving better robust-ness and accuracy in real-world driving conditions.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18629	Towards Human-Understandable Multi-Dimensional Concept Discovery	Arne GrobrÃ¼gge, Niklas KÃ¼hl, Gerhard Satzger, Philipp Spitzer	Concept-based eXplainable AI (C-XAI) aims to overcome the limitations of traditional saliency maps by converting pixels into human-understandable concepts that are consistent across an entire dataset. A crucial aspect of C-XAI is completeness, which measures how well a set of concepts explains a model's decisions. Among C-XAI methods, Multi-Dimensional Concept Discovery (MCD) effectively improves completeness by breaking down the CNN latent space into distinct and interpretable concept subspaces. However, MCD's explanations can be difficult for humans to understand, raising concerns about their practical utility. To address this, we propose Human-Understandable Multi-dimensional Concept Discovery (HU-MCD). HU-MCD uses the Segment Anything Model for concept identification and implements a CNN-specific input masking technique to reduce noise introduced by traditional masking methods. These changes to MCD, paired with the completeness relation, enable HU-MCD to enhance concept understandability while maintaining explanation faithfulness. Our experiments, including human subject studies, show that HU-MCD provides more precise and reliable explanations than existing C-XAI methods. The code is available at this https URL.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18627	Dig2DIG: Dig into Diffusion Information Gains for Image Fusion	Bing Cao, Baoshuo Cai, Changqing Zhang, Qinghua Hu	Image fusion integrates complementary information from multi-source images to generate more informative results. Recently, the diffusion model, which demonstrates unprecedented generative potential, has been explored in image fusion. However, these approaches typically incorporate predefined multimodal guidance into diffusion, failing to capture the dynamically changing significance of each modality, while lacking theoretical guarantees. To address this issue, we reveal a significant spatio-temporal imbalance in image denoising; specifically, the diffusion model produces dynamic information gains in different image regions with denoising steps. Based on this observation, we Dig into the Diffusion Information Gains (Dig2DIG) and theoretically derive a diffusion-based dynamic image fusion framework that provably reduces the upper bound of the generalization error. Accordingly, we introduce diffusion information gains (DIG) to quantify the information contribution of each modality at different denoising steps, thereby providing dynamic guidance during the fusion process. Extensive experiments on multiple fusion scenarios confirm that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based approaches in terms of both fusion quality and inference efficiency.

The generator may produce any number of images under a preserved evaluation time. In this work, we leverage the popular diffusion model as the generator to compute a surrogate dataset, boosted by a min-max loss to control the dataset's diversity and representativeness during training. However, the diffusion model is time-consuming when generating images, as it requires an iterative generation process. We observe a critical trade-off between the number of image samples and the image quality controlled by the diffusion steps and propose Diffusion Step Reduction to achieve optimal performance. This paper details our comprehensive method and its performance.

Existing personalization methods address this limitation but heavily rely on training procedures, that can be either costly or unpleasant to individual users. We depart from existing work, and for the first time explore the training-free setting in the context of personalization. We propose a novel method, Retrieval and Reasoning for Personalization (R2P), leveraging internal knowledge of VLMs. First, we leverage VLMs to extract the concept fingerprint, i.e., key attributes uniquely defining the concept within its semantic class. When a query arrives, the most similar fingerprints are retrieved and scored via chain-of-thought-reasoning. To reduce the risk of hallucinations, the scores are validated through cross-modal verification at the attribute level: in case of a discrepancy between the scores, R2P refines the concept association via pairwise multimodal matching, where the retrieved fingerprints and their images are directly compared with the query. We validate R2P on two publicly available benchmarks and a newly introduced dataset, Personal Concepts with Visual Ambiguity (PerVA), for concept identification highlighting challenges in visual ambiguity. R2P consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various downstream tasks across all benchmarks. Code will be available upon acceptance.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18589	Unified Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion for Multi-Agent Trajectory Modeling	Guillem Capellera, Antonio Rubio, Luis Ferraz, Antonio Agudo	Multi-agent trajectory modeling has primarily focused on forecasting future states, often overlooking broader tasks like trajectory completion, which are crucial for real-world applications such as correcting tracking data. Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18583	Adapting Video Diffusion Models for Time-Lapse Microscopy	Alexander Holmberg, Nils Mechtel, Wei Ouyang	We present a domain adaptation of video diffusion models to generate highly realistic time-lapse microscopy videos of cell division in HeLa cells. Although state-of-the-art generative video models have advanced significantly for natural videos, they remain underexplored in microscopy domains. To address this gap, we fine-tune a pretrained video diffusion model on microscopy-specific sequences, exploring three conditioning strategies: (1) text prompts derived from numeric phenotypic measurements (e.g., proliferation rates, migration speeds, cell-death frequencies), (2) direct numeric embeddings of phenotype scores, and (3) image-conditioned generation, where an initial microscopy frame is extended into a complete video sequence. Evaluation using biologically meaningful morphological, proliferation, and migration metrics demonstrates that fine-tuning substantially improves realism and accurately captures critical cellular behaviors such as mitosis and migration. Notably, the fine-tuned model also generalizes beyond the training horizon, generating coherent cell dynamics even in extended sequences. However, precisely controlling specific phenotypic characteristics remains challenging, highlighting opportunities for future work to enhance conditioning methods. Our results demonstrate the potential for domain-specific fine-tuning of generative video models to produce biologically plausible synthetic microscopy data, supporting applications such as in-silico hypothesis testing and data augmentation.

However, due to the complexity of the domain shift problem, the performance of existing models will degrade, especially when it comes to multi-domain or cross-domain tasks. In this paper, we propose a Test-time style transfer (T3s) that uses a bidirectional mapping mechanism to project the features of the source and target domains into a unified feature space, enhancing the generalization ability of the model. To further increase the style expression space, we introduce a Cross-domain style diversification module (CSDM) to ensure the orthogonality between style bases. In addition, data augmentation and low-rank adaptation techniques are used to improve feature alignment and sensitivity, enabling the model to adapt to multi-domain inputs effectively. Our method has demonstrated effectiveness on three unseen datasets.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18559	AMD-Hummingbird: Towards an Efficient Text-to-Video Model	Takashi Isobe, He Cui, Dong Zhou, Mengmeng Ge, Dong Li, Emad Barsoum	Text-to-Video (T2V) generation has attracted significant attention for its ability to synthesize realistic videos from textual descriptions. However, existing models struggle to balance computational efficiency and high visual quality, particularly on resource-limited devices, e.g.,iGPUs and mobile phones. Most prior work prioritizes visual fidelity while overlooking the need for smaller, more efficient models suitable for real-world deployment. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight T2V framework, termed Hummingbird, which prunes existing models and enhances visual quality through visual feedback learning. Our approach reduces the size of the U-Net from 1.4 billion to 0.7 billion parameters, significantly improving efficiency while preserving high-quality video generation. Additionally, we introduce a novel data processing pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models to enhance the quality of both text prompts and video data. To support user-driven training and style customization, we publicly release the full training code, including data processing and model training. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 31X speedup compared to state-of-the-art models such as VideoCrafter2, while also attaining the highest overall score on VBench. Moreover, our method supports the generation of videos with up to 26 frames, addressing the limitations of existing U-Net-based methods in long video generation. Notably, the entire training process requires only four GPUs, yet delivers performance competitive with existing leading methods. Hummingbird presents a practical and efficient solution for T2V generation, combining high performance, scalability, and flexibility for real-world applications.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18557	LeanStereo: A Leaner Backbone based Stereo Network	Rafia Rahim, Samuel Woerz, Andreas Zell	Recently, end-to-end deep networks based stereo matching methods, mainly because of their performance, have gained popularity. However, this improvement in performance comes at the cost of increased computational and memory bandwidth requirements, thus necessitating specialized hardware (GPUs); even then, these methods have large inference times compared to classical methods. This limits their applicability in real-world applications. Although we desire high accuracy stereo methods albeit with reasonable inference time. To this end, we propose a fast end-to-end stereo matching method. Majority of this speedup comes from integrating a leaner backbone. To recover the performance lost because of a leaner backbone, we propose to use learned attention weights based cost volume combined with LogL1 loss for stereo matching. Using LogL1 loss not only improves the overall performance of the proposed network but also leads to faster convergence. We do a detailed empirical evaluation of different design choices and show that our method requires 4x less operations and is also about 9 to 14x faster compared to the state of the art methods like ACVNet [1], LEAStereo [2] and CFNet [3] while giving comparable performance.

It is reported that these models tend to over-focus on certain irrelevant image tokens that do not contain critical information for answering the question and distort the output. To address this, we propose an Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention(IAVA) approach, which identifies irrelevant tokens by comparing changes in attention weights under two different instructions. By applying contrastive decoding, we dynamically adjust the logits generated from original image tokens and irrelevant image tokens, reducing the model's over-attention to irrelevant information. The experimental results demonstrate that IAVA consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques on benchmarks such as MME, POPE, and TextVQA in mitigating object hallucinations. Our IAVA approach is available online at this https URL.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Computation and Language (cs.CL)	24/03/2025

However, existing atomic activity datasets are collected from an egocentric view, which cannot support the scenarios where traffic activities in an entire intersection are required. Moreover, existing datasets only provide video-level atomic activity annotations, which require exhausting efforts to manually trim the videos for recognition and limit their applications to untrimmed videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Aerial Traffic Atomic Activity Recognition and Segmentation (ATARS) dataset, the first aerial dataset designed for multi-label atomic activity analysis. We offer atomic activity labels for each frame, which accurately record the intervals for traffic activities. Moreover, we propose a novel task, Multi-label Temporal Atomic Activity Recognition, enabling the study of accurate temporal localization for atomic activity and easing the burden of manual video trimming for recognition. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate existing state-of-the-art models on both atomic activity recognition and temporal atomic activity segmentation. The results highlight the unique challenges of our ATARS dataset, such as recognizing extremely small objects' activities. We further provide comprehensive discussion analyzing these challenges and offer valuable insights for future direction to improve recognizing atomic activity in aerial view.

In contrast, event cameras provide data streams with exceptionally high temporal resolution, a wide dynamic range, and inherent resistance to motion blur and exposure issues. In this work, we propose EvAnimate, a framework that leverages event streams as motion cues to animate static human images. Our approach employs a specialized event representation that transforms asynchronous event streams into 3-channel slices with controllable slicing rates and appropriate slice density, ensuring compatibility with diffusion models. Subsequently, a dual-branch architecture generates high-quality videos by harnessing the inherent motion dynamics of the event streams, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal consistency. Specialized data augmentation strategies further enhance cross-person generalization. Finally, we establish a new benchmarking, including simulated event data for training and validation, and a real-world event dataset capturing human actions under normal and extreme scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that EvAnimate achieves high temporal fidelity and robust performance in scenarios where traditional video-derived cues fall short.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18548	Benchmarking Post-Hoc Unknown-Category Detection in Food Recognition	Lubnaa Abdur Rahman, Ioannis Papathanail, Lorenzo Brigato, Stavroula Mougiakakou	Food recognition models often struggle to distinguish between seen and unseen samples, frequently misclassifying samples from unseen categories by assigning them an in-distribution (ID) label. This misclassification presents significant challenges when deploying these models in real-world applications, particularly within automatic dietary assessment systems, where incorrect labels can lead to cascading errors throughout the system. Ideally, such models should prompt the user when an unknown sample is encountered, allowing for corrective action. Given no prior research exploring food recognition in real-world settings, in this work we conduct an empirical analysis of various post-hoc out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods for fine-grained food recognition. Our findings indicate that virtual logit matching (ViM) performed the best overall, likely due to its combination of logits and feature-space representations. Additionally, our work reinforces prior notions in the OOD domain, noting that models with higher ID accuracy performed better across the evaluated OOD detection methods. Furthermore, transformer-based architectures consistently outperformed convolution-based models in detecting OOD samples across various methods.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18544	Distilling Stereo Networks for Performant and Efficient Leaner Networks	Rafia Rahim, Samuel Woerz, Andreas Zell	Knowledge distillation has been quite popular in vision for tasks like classification and segmentation however not much work has been done for distilling state-of-the-art stereo matching methods despite their range of applications. One of the reasons for its lack of use in stereo matching networks is due to the inherent complexity of these networks, where a typical network is composed of multiple two- and three-dimensional modules. In this work, we systematically combine the insights from state-of-the-art stereo methods with general knowledge-distillation techniques to develop a joint framework for stereo networks distillation with competitive results and faster inference. Moreover, we show, via a detailed empirical analysis, that distilling knowledge from the stereo network requires careful design of the complete distillation pipeline starting from backbone to the right selection of distillation points and corresponding loss functions. This results in the student networks that are not only leaner and faster but give excellent performance . For instance, our student network while performing better than the performance oriented methods like PSMNet [1], CFNet [2], and LEAStereo [3]) on benchmark SceneFlow dataset, is 8x, 5x, and 8x faster respectively. Furthermore, compared to speed oriented methods having inference time less than 100ms, our student networks perform better than all the tested methods. In addition, our student network also shows better generalization capabilities when tested on unseen datasets like ETH3D and Middlebury.	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	24/03/2025
10.48550/arXiv.2503.18541	UniPCGC: Towards Practical Point Cloud Geometry Compression via an Efficient Unified Approach	Kangli Wang, Wei Gao	Learning-based point cloud compression methods have made significant progress in terms of performance. However, these methods still encounter challenges including high complexity, limited compression modes, and a lack of support for variable rate, which restrict the practical application of these methods. In order to promote the development of practical point cloud compression, we propose an efficient unified point cloud geometry compression framework, dubbed as UniPCGC. It is a lightweight framework that supports lossy compression, lossless compression, variable rate and variable complexity. First, we introduce the Uneven 8-Stage Lossless Coder (UELC) in the lossless mode, which allocates more computational complexity to groups with higher coding difficulty, and merges groups with lower coding difficulty. Second, Variable Rate and Complexity Module (VRCM) is achieved in the lossy mode through joint adoption of a rate modulation module and dynamic sparse convolution. Finally, through the dynamic combination of UELC and VRCM, we achieve lossy compression, lossless compression, variable rate and complexity within a unified framework. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, our method achieves a compression ratio (CR) gain of 8.1\% on lossless compression, and a Bjontegaard Delta Rate (BD-Rate) gain of 14.02\% on lossy compression, while also supporting variable rate and variable complexity.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18540	HiRes-FusedMIM: A High-Resolution RGB-DSM Pre-trained Model for Building-Level Remote Sensing Applications	Guneet Mutreja, Philipp Schuegraf, Ksenia Bittner	Recent advances in self-supervised learning have led to the development of foundation models that have significantly advanced performance in various computer vision tasks. However, despite their potential, these models often overlook the crucial role of high-resolution digital surface models (DSMs) in understanding urban environments, particularly for building-level analysis, which is essential for applications like digital twins. To address this gap, we introduce HiRes-FusedMIM, a novel pre-trained model specifically designed to leverage the rich information contained within high-resolution RGB and DSM data. HiRes-FusedMIM utilizes a dual-encoder simple masked image modeling (SimMIM) architecture with a multi-objective loss function that combines reconstruction and contrastive objectives, enabling it to learn powerful, joint representations from both modalities. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of HiRes-FusedMIM on a diverse set of downstream tasks, including classification, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Our results demonstrate that: 1) HiRes-FusedMIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art geospatial methods on several building-related datasets, including WHU Aerial and LoveDA, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing and leveraging fine-grained building information; 2) Incorporating DSMs during pre-training consistently improves performance compared to using RGB data alone, highlighting the value of elevation information for building-level analysis; 3) The dual-encoder architecture of HiRes-FusedMIM, with separate encoders for RGB and DSM data, significantly outperforms a single-encoder model on the Vaihingen segmentation task, indicating the benefits of learning specialized representations for each modality. To facilitate further research and applications in this direction, we will publicly release the trained model weights.

10.48550/arXiv.2503.18536	DiN: Diffusion Model for Robust Medical VQA with Semantic Noisy Labels	Erjian Guo, Zhen Zhao, Zicheng Wang, Tong Chen, Yunyi Liu, Luping Zhou	Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) systems benefit the interpretation of medical images containing critical clinical information. However, the challenge of noisy labels and limited high-quality datasets remains underexplored. To address this, we establish the first benchmark for noisy labels in Med-VQA by simulating human mislabeling with semantically designed noise types. More importantly, we introduce the DiN framework, which leverages a diffusion model to handle noisy labels in Med-VQA. Unlike the dominant classification-based VQA approaches that directly predict answers, our Answer Diffuser (AD) module employs a coarse-to-fine process, refining answer candidates with a diffusion model for improved accuracy. The Answer Condition Generator (ACG) further enhances this process by generating task-specific conditional information via integrating answer embeddings with fused image-question features. To address label noise, our Noisy Label Refinement(NLR) module introduces a robust loss function and dynamic answer adjustment to further boost the performance of the AD module.
