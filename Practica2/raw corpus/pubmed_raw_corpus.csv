10.1073/pnas.2121425119	A Pleistocene legacy structures variation in modern seagrass ecosystems.	Duffy JE, Stachowicz JJ, Reynolds PL, Hovel KA, Jahnke M, Sotka EE, Boström C, Boyer KE, Cusson M, Eklöf J, Engelen AH, Eriksson BK, Fodrie FJ, Griffin JN, Hereu CM, Hori M, Hughes AR, Ivanov MV, Jorgensen P, Kruschel C, Lee KS, Lefcheck JS, Moksnes PO, Nakaoka M, O&#x27;Connor MI, O&#x27;Connor NE, Orth RJ, Peterson BJ, Reiss H, Reiss K, Richardson JP, Rossi F, Ruesink JL, Schultz ST, Thormar J, Tomas F, Unsworth R, Voigt E, Whalen MA, Ziegler SL, Olsen JL	Distribution of Earth&#x27;s biomes is structured by the match between climate and plant traits, which in turn shape associated communities and ecosystem processes and services. However, that climate-trait match can be disrupted by historical events, with lasting ecosystem impacts. As Earth&#x27;s environment changes faster than at any time in human history, critical questions are whether and how organismal traits and ecosystems can adjust to altered conditions. We quantified the relative importance of current environmental forcing versus evolutionary history in shaping the growth form (stature and biomass) and associated community of eelgrass (Zostera marina), a widespread foundation plant of marine ecosystems along Northern Hemisphere coastlines, which experienced major shifts in distribution and genetic composition during the Pleistocene. We found that eelgrass stature and biomass retain a legacy of the Pleistocene colonization of the Atlantic from the ancestral Pacific range and of more recent within-basin bottlenecks and genetic differentiation. This evolutionary legacy in turn influences the biomass of associated algae and invertebrates that fuel coastal food webs, with effects comparable to or stronger than effects of current environmental forcing. Such historical lags in phenotypic acclimatization may constrain ecosystem adjustments to rapid anthropogenic climate change, thus altering predictions about the future functioning of ecosystems.

10.3390/jimaging10080192	RailTrack-DaViT: A Vision Transformer-Based Approach for Automated Railway Track	Phaphuangwittayakul A, Harnpornchai N, Ying F, Zhang J	Railway track defects pose significant safety risks and can lead to accidents, economic losses, and loss of life. Traditional manual inspection methods are either time-consuming, costly, or prone to human error. This paper proposes RailTrack-DaViT, a novel vision transformer-based approach for railway track defect classification. By leveraging the Dual Attention Vision Transformer (DaViT) architecture, RailTrack-DaViT effectively captures both global and local information, enabling accurate defect detection. The model is trained and evaluated on multiple datasets including rail, fastener and fishplate, multi-faults, and ThaiRailTrack. A comprehensive analysis of the model&#x27;s performance is provided including confusion matrices, training visualizations, and classification metrics. RailTrack-DaViT demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based methods, achieving the highest accuracies: 96.9% on the rail dataset, 98.9% on the fastener and fishplate dataset, and 98.8% on the multi-faults dataset. Moreover, RailTrack-DaViT outperforms baselines on the ThaiRailTrack dataset with 99.2% accuracy, quickly adapts to unseen images, and shows better model stability during fine-tuning. This capability can significantly reduce time consumption when applying the model to novel datasets in practical applications. 	Journal of imaging	07/08/2024
10.3390/jimaging10090227	Leveraging Perspective Transformation for Enhanced Pothole Detection in	Abu-Raddaha A, El-Shair ZA, Rawashdeh S	Road conditions, often degraded by insufficient maintenance or adverse weather, significantly contribute to accidents, exacerbated by the limited human reaction time to sudden hazards like potholes. Early detection of distant potholes is crucial for timely corrective actions, such as reducing speed or avoiding obstacles, to mitigate vehicle damage and accidents. This paper introduces a novel approach that utilizes perspective transformation to enhance pothole detection at different distances, focusing particularly on distant potholes. Perspective transformation improves the visibility and clarity of potholes by virtually bringing them closer and enlarging their features, which is particularly beneficial given the fixed-size input requirement of object detection networks, typically significantly smaller than the raw image resolutions captured by cameras. Our method automatically identifies the region of interest (ROI)-the road area-and calculates the corner points to generate a perspective transformation matrix. This matrix is applied to all images and corresponding bounding box labels, enhancing the representation of potholes in the dataset. This approach significantly boosts detection performance when used with YOLOv5-small, achieving a 43% improvement in the average precision (AP) metric at intersection-over-union thresholds of 0.5 to 0.95 for single class evaluation, and notable improvements of 34%, 63%, and 194% for near, medium, and far potholes, respectively, after categorizing them based on their distance. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to employ perspective transformation specifically for enhancing the detection of distant potholes. 	Journal of imaging	14/09/2024
10.1016/j.cell.2025.02.022	Meningeal lymphatics-microglia axis regulates synaptic physiology.	Kim K, Abramishvili D, Du S, Papadopoulos Z, Cao J, Herz J, Smirnov I, Thomas JL, Colonna M, Kipnis J	Meningeal lymphatics serve as an outlet for cerebrospinal fluid, and their dysfunction is associated with various neurodegenerative conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that dysfunctional meningeal lymphatics evoke behavioral changes, but the neural mechanisms underlying these changes have remained elusive. Here, we show that prolonged impairment of meningeal lymphatics alters the balance of cortical excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, accompanied by deficits in memory tasks. These synaptic and behavioral alterations induced by lymphatic dysfunction are mediated by microglia, leading to increased expression of the interleukin 6 gene (Il6). IL-6 drives inhibitory synapse phenotypes via a combination of trans- and classical IL-6 signaling. Restoring meningeal lymphatic function in aged mice reverses age-associated synaptic and behavioral alterations. Our findings suggest that dysfunctional meningeal lymphatics adversely impact cortical circuitry through an IL-6-dependent mechanism and identify a potential target for treating aging-associated cognitive decline.

10.3390/jimaging10080197	A Multi-Scale Target Detection Method Using an Improved Faster Region	Chen Q, Li M, Lai Z, Zhu J, Guan L	Currently, existing deep learning methods exhibit many limitations in multi-target detection, such as low accuracy and high rates of false detection and missed detections. This paper proposes an improved Faster R-CNN algorithm, aiming to enhance the algorithm&#x27;s capability in detecting multi-scale targets. This algorithm has three improvements based on Faster R-CNN. Firstly, the new algorithm uses the ResNet101 network for feature extraction of the detection image, which achieves stronger feature extraction capabilities. Secondly, the new algorithm integrates Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM), Soft non-maximum suppression (Soft-NMS), and Distance Intersection Over Union (DIOU) modules, which improves the positive and negative sample imbalance and the problem of small targets being easily missed during model training. Finally, the Region Proposal Network (RPN) is simplified to achieve a faster detection speed and a lower miss rate. The multi-scale training (MST) strategy is also used to train the improved Faster R-CNN to achieve a balance between detection accuracy and efficiency. Compared to the other detection models, the improved Faster R-CNN demonstrates significant advantages in terms of mAP@0.5, F1-score, and Log average miss rate (LAMR). The model proposed in this paper provides valuable insights and inspiration for many fields, such as smart agriculture, medical diagnosis, and face recognition. 	Journal of imaging	13/08/2024
10.3390/jimaging10090215	Concrete Crack Detection and Segregation: A Feature Fusion, Crack Isolation, and	Swarna RA, Hossain MM, Khatun MR, Rahman MM, Munir A	Scientific knowledge of image-based crack detection methods is limited in understanding their performance across diverse crack sizes, types, and environmental conditions. Builders and engineers often face difficulties with image resolution, detecting fine cracks, and differentiating between structural and non-structural issues. Enhanced algorithms and analysis techniques are needed for more accurate assessments. Hence, this research aims to generate an intelligent scheme that can recognize the presence of cracks and visualize the percentage of cracks from an image along with an explanation. The proposed method fuses features from concrete surface images through a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) and curvelet transform handcrafted (HC) method, optimized by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) classifier then uses these features to recognize cracks. This study evaluates several CNN models, including VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception-V3, and ResNet-50, and various HC techniques, such as wavelet transform, counterlet transform, and curvelet transform for feature extraction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and LDA are assessed for feature optimization. For classification, XGB, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and category boosting (CatBoost) are tested. To isolate and quantify the crack region, this research combines image thresholding, morphological operations, and contour detection with the convex hulls method and forms a novel algorithm. Two explainable AI (XAI) tools, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIMEs) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping++ (Grad-CAM++) are integrated with the proposed method to enhance result clarity. This research introduces a novel feature fusion approach that enhances crack detection accuracy and interpretability. The method demonstrates superior performance by achieving 99.93% and 99.69% accuracy on two existing datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the development of an algorithm for isolating and quantifying crack regions represents a significant advancement in image processing for structural analysis. The proposed approach provides a robust and reliable tool for real-time crack detection and assessment in concrete structures, facilitating timely maintenance and improving structural safety. By offering detailed explanations of the model&#x27;s decisions, the research addresses the critical need for transparency in AI applications, thus increasing trust and adoption in engineering practice.

10.1182/blood.2024027620	Daratumumab-Bortezomib-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone for Newly Diagnosed Myeloma:	Corre J, Vincent L, Moreau P, Hebraud B, Hulin C, Béné MC, Broijl A, Caillot D, Delforge M, Dejoie T, Facon T, Lambert J, Leleu X, Macro M Dr, Perrot A, Zweegman S, Filleron T, Cabarrou B, van de Donk NWCJ, Mahéo S, Hua W, Wang J, Krevvata M, Vanquickelberghe V, de Boer C, Tuozzo A, Borgsten F, Rowe M, Carson R, Wuilleme S, Sonneveld P	Previous results from CASSIOPEIA (NCT02541383) demonstrated superior progression-free survival (PFS) and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity with the addition of daratumumab to bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone (VTd) induction/consolidation and with daratumumab maintenance versus observation in transplant-eligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). Here, we present long-term MRD status and PFS outcomes after an 80.1-month median follow-up. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to daratumumab plus VTd (D-VTd) or VTd induction/consolidation; patients remaining on study were re-randomized to daratumumab maintenance or observation for £2 years. MRD status was assessed at pre-defined timepoints during each study phase. D-VTd improved overall MRD-negativity rates (10-5) post-induction (34.6% vs 23.1%; P&lt;0.0001) and post-consolidation (63.7% vs 43.7%; P&lt;0.0001) and provided PFS benefit, regardless of post-induction MRD status, versus VTd alone. Daratumumab maintenance improved overall MRD-negativity rates over observation, regardless of induction/consolidation treatment (D-VTd/daratumumab vs D-VTd/observation: 10-5, 77.3% vs 70.7% [P=0.0417]; 10-6, 60.7% vs 52.0% [P=0.0365]; VTd/daratumumab vs VTd/observation: 10-5, 70.9% vs 51.2% [P&lt;0.0001]; 10-6, 48.4% vs 30.7% [P&lt;0.0001]), and improved MRD-negativity rates, regardless of risk status, as defined by cytogenetic abnormalities or revised International Staging System score. Further, daratumumab maintenance provided PFS benefit versus observation, regardless of induction/consolidation treatment and post-consolidation MRD status. D-VTd followed by daratumumab maintenance consistently produced the highest landmark, accumulative, and sustained MRD-negativity rates (10-5 and 10-6), translating to superior long-term PFS outcomes. These results demonstrate that daratumumab-based induction/consolidation followed by daratumumab maintenance resulted in the deepest and most durable MRD negativity, leading to superior PFS outcomes.

10.7554/eLife.101973	ORMDL3 restrains type I interferon signaling and anti-tumor immunity by promoting	Zeng Q, Yao C, Zhang S, Mao Y, Wang J, Wang Z, Sheng C, Chen S	Mounting evidence has demonstrated the genetic association of ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3 (ORMDL3) gene polymorphisms with bronchial asthma and a diverse set of inflammatory disorders. However, its role in type I interferon (type I IFN) signaling remains poorly defined. Herein, we report that ORMDL3 is a negative modulator of the type I IFN signaling by interacting with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and subsequently promoting the proteasome-mediated degradation of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). Immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays uncovered that ORMDL3 binds to ubiquitin-specific protease 10 (USP10), which forms a complex with and stabilizes RIG-I through decreasing its K48-linked ubiquitination. ORMDL3 thus disrupts the interaction between USP10 and RIG-I, thereby promoting RIG-I degradation. Additionally, subcutaneous syngeneic tumor models in C57BL/6 mice revealed that inhibition of ORMDL3 enhances anti-tumor efficacy by augmenting the proportion of cytotoxic CD8 positive T cells and IFN production in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Collectively, our findings reveal the pivotal roles of ORMDL3 in maintaining antiviral innate immune responses and anti-tumor immunity. 	eLife	24/03/2025
10.3390/jimaging10090208	Task-Adaptive Angle Selection for Computed Tomography-Based Defect Detection.	Wang T, Florian V, Schielein R, Kretzer C, Kasperl S, Lucka F, van Leeuwen T	Sparse-angle X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) plays a vital role in industrial quality control but leads to an inherent trade-off between scan time and reconstruction quality. Adaptive angle selection strategies try to improve upon this based on the idea that the geometry of the object under investigation leads to an uneven distribution of the information content over the projection angles. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as an effective approach for adaptive angle selection in X-ray CT. While previous studies focused on optimizing generic image quality measures using a fixed number of angles, our work extends them by considering a specific downstream task, namely image-based defect detection, and introducing flexibility in the number of angles used. By leveraging prior knowledge about typical defect characteristics, our task-adaptive angle selection method, adaptable in terms of angle count, enables easy detection of defects in the reconstructed images.

10.1001/jama.2025.3579	Microultrasonography-Guided vs MRI-Guided Biopsy for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis:	Kinnaird A, Luger F, Cash H, Ghai S, Urdaneta-Salegui LF, Pavlovich CP, Brito J, Shore ND, Struck JP, Schostak M, Harland N, Rodriguez-Socarrás M, Brisbane WG, Lughezzani G, Toledano H, Ouertani MS, Macek P, Fung C, Tu W, Gusenleitner A, Günzel K, Incze PF, George AK, Pereira JG, Jansen R, Renzulli J 2nd, Klotz L	IMPORTANCE: High-resolution microultrasonography-guided biopsy is an alternative to MRI fusion-guided biopsy for prostate cancer diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To compare microultrasonography-guided and MRI fusion-guided biopsy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A multicenter, international, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial of biopsy-naive men from 20 centers (8 countries) with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (elevated prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and/or abnormal digital rectal examination findings) from December 2021 to September 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were assigned to receive either microultrasonography-guided biopsy (n = 121), microultrasonography/MRI fusion-guided biopsy (microultrasonography/MRI; n = 226, in which microultrasonography biopsies were performed prior to unblinding the MRI), or MRI/conventional US fusion-guided biopsy (MRI/conventional ultrasonography; n = 331). All participants received synchronous systematic biopsy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the difference in detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancers using microultrasonography plus systematic biopsy vs MRI/conventional ultrasonography plus systematic biopsy. The secondary outcome was the difference in detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancers found using microultrasonography/MRI plus systematic biopsy vs MRI/conventional ultrasonography plus systematic biopsy. The noninferiority margin was set at 10%. RESULTS: A total of 802 men underwent randomization and 678 underwent biopsy. Median (IQR) age was 65 (59-70) years and prostate-specific antigen level was 6.9 (5.2-9.8) ng/mL; 83% self-identified as White. Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancer was detected in 57 participants (47.1%) in the microultrasonography group, in 141 (42.6%) in the MRI/conventional ultrasonography group, and in 106 (46.9%) in the microultrasonography/MRI group. Microultrasonography-guided biopsy was noninferior to MRI fusion-guided biopsy (difference, 3.52% [95% CI, -3.95% to 10.92%]; noninferiority P &lt; .001). Combined biopsy with microultrasonography/MRI was also noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography software-assisted MRI fusion biopsy using conventional ultrasonography devices (difference, 4.29% [95% CI, -4.06% to 12.63%]; noninferiority P &lt; .001). The rate of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancer diagnosed by targeted biopsy only was 38.0% in the microultrasonography group, 34.1% in the MRI/conventional ultrasonography group, and 40.3% in the microultrasonography/MRI group; these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The use of microultrasonography-guided biopsy was noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy for the detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer in biopsy-naive men. Microultrasonography may provide an alternative to MRI for image-guided prostate biopsy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05220501. 	JAMA	23/03/2025
10.1038/s41467-025-57879-3	Associations of 2923 plasma proteins with incident inflammatory bowel disease in	Zhang X, Zhao H, Wan M, Man J, Zhang T, Yang X, Lu M	The prospective relationship between proteomics and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains largely underexplored, presenting potential of therapeutic interventions. Using data from 48,800 IBD-free participants in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP), we assessed associations between 2923 plasma proteins and incident IBD risk using Cox analysis. Mendelian randomization (MR) meta-analysis, integrating cis-protein quantitative trait loci data from the UKB-PPP with IBD genome-wide association study data from the International Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium and FinnGen studies, identified causal proteins. Colocalization analysis strengthened evidence of shared common causal variants. Cohort study revealed associations of 673, 295, and 125 proteins with the risk of IBD, Crohn&#x27;s disease (CD), and ulcerative colitis (UC), respectively. MR and colocalization analyses prioritized IL12B, CD6, MXRA8, CXCL9, IFNG, CCN3, RSPO3, and IL18 as having causal and high colocalization evidence with IBD or its subtypes. Our findings advance understanding of IBD&#x27;s molecular etiology and highlight potential therapeutic targets. 	Nature communications	21/03/2025
10.1038/s41586-025-08732-6	VDAC2 loss elicits tumour destruction and inflammation for cancer therapy.	Yuan S, Sun R, Shi H, Chapman NM, Hu H, Guy C, Rankin S, Kc A, Palacios G, Meng X, Sun X, Zhou P, Yang X, Gottschalk S, Chi H	Tumour cells often evade immune pressure exerted by CD8(+) T cells or immunotherapies through mechanisms that are largely unclear(1,2). Here, using complementary in vivo and in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens to target metabolic factors, we established voltage-dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) as an immune signal-dependent checkpoint that curtails interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated tumour destruction and inflammatory reprogramming of the tumour microenvironment. Targeting VDAC2 in tumour cells enabled IFNγ-induced cell death and cGAS-STING activation, and markedly improved anti-tumour effects and immunotherapeutic responses. Using a genome-scale genetic interaction screen, we identified BAK as the mediator of VDAC2-deficiency-induced effects. Mechanistically, IFNγ stimulation increased BIM, BID and BAK expression, with VDAC2 deficiency eliciting uncontrolled IFNγ-induced BAK activation and mitochondrial damage. Consequently, mitochondrial DNA was aberrantly released into the cytosol and triggered robust activation of cGAS-STING signalling and type I IFN response. Importantly, co-deletion of STING signalling components dampened the therapeutic effects of VDAC2 depletion in tumour cells, suggesting that targeting VDAC2 integrates CD8(+) T cell- and IFNγ-mediated adaptive immunity with a tumour-intrinsic innate immune-like response. Together, our findings reveal VDAC2 as a dual-action target to overcome tumour immune evasion and establish the importance of coordinately destructing and inflaming tumours to enable efficacious cancer immunotherapy.

10.1016/j.cmet.2025.02.007	Dietary timing enhances exercise by modulating fat-muscle crosstalk via adipocyte	Chen J, Xiang J, Zhou M, Huang R, Zhang J, Cui Y, Jiang X, Li Y, Zhou R, Xin H, Li J, Li L, Lam SM, Zhu J, Chen Y, Yang Q, Xie Z, Shui G, Deng F, Zhang Z, Li MD	Feeding rhythms regulate exercise performance and muscle energy metabolism. However, the mechanisms regulating adipocyte functions remain unclear. Here, using multi-omics analyses, involving (phospho-)proteomics and lipidomics, we found that day-restricted feeding (DRF) regulates diurnal rhythms of the mitochondrial proteome, neutral lipidome, and nutrient-sensing pathways in mouse gonadal white adipose tissue (GWAT). Adipocyte-specific knockdown of Prkaa2 (the gene encoding AMPKα2) impairs physical endurance. This defect is associated with altered rhythmicity in acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) metabolism-related genes, a loss of rhythmicity in the GWAT lipidome, and circadian remodeling of serum metabolites-in particular, lactate and succinate. We also found that adipocyte Prkaa2 regulates muscle clock genes during DRF. Notably, oral administration of the AMPK activator C29 increases endurance and muscle functions in a time-of-day manner, which requires intact adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling. Collectively, our work defines adipocyte AMPKα2 signaling as a critical regulator of circadian metabolic coordination between fat and muscle, thereby enhancing exercise performance.

10.1016/S0140-6736(24)02840-X	Global, regional, and national burden of household air pollution, 1990-2021: a		BACKGROUND: Despite a substantial reduction in the use of solid fuels for cooking worldwide, exposure to household air pollution (HAP) remains a leading global risk factor, contributing considerably to the burden of disease. We present a comprehensive analysis of spatial patterns and temporal trends in exposure and attributable disease from 1990 to 2021, featuring substantial methodological updates compared with previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, including improved exposure estimations accounting for specific fuel types. METHODS: We estimated HAP exposure and trends and attributable burden for cataract, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, tracheal cancer, bronchus cancer, lung cancer, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and causes mediated via adverse reproductive outcomes for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We first estimated the mean fuel type-specific concentrations (in μg/m(3)) of fine particulate matter (PM(2·5)) pollution to which individuals using solid fuels for cooking were exposed, categorised by fuel type, location, year, age, and sex. Using a systematic review of the epidemiological literature and a newly developed meta-regression tool (meta-regression: Bayesian, regularised, trimmed), we derived disease-specific, non-parametric exposure-response curves to estimate relative risk as a function of PM(2·5) concentration. We combined our exposure estimates and relative risks to estimate population attributable fractions and attributable burden for each cause by sex, age, location, and year. FINDINGS: In 2021, 2·67 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 2·63-2·71) people, 33·8% (95% UI 33·2-34·3) of the global population, were exposed to HAP from all sources at a mean concentration of 84·2 μg/m(3). Although these figures show a notable reduction in the percentage of the global population exposed in 1990 (56·7%, 56·4-57·1), in absolute terms, there has been only a decline of 0·35 billion (10%) from the 3·02 billion people exposed to HAP in 1990. In 2021, 111 million (95% UI 75·1-164) global disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were attributable to HAP, accounting for 3·9% (95% UI 2·6-5·7) of all DALYs. The rate of global, HAP-attributable DALYs in 2021 was 1500·3 (95% UI 1028·4-2195·6) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population, a decline of 63·8% since 1990, when HAP-attributable DALYs comprised 4147·7 (3101·4-5104·6) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population. HAP-attributable burden remained highest in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, with 4044·1 (3103·4-5219·7) and 3213·5 (2165·4-4409·4) age-standardised DALYs per 100 000 population, respectively. The rate of HAP-attributable DALYs was higher for males (1530·5, 1023·4-2263·6) than for females (1318·5, 866·1-1977·2). Approximately one-third of the HAP-attributable burden (518·1, 410·1-641·7) was mediated via short gestation and low birthweight. Decomposition of trends and drivers behind changes in the HAP-attributable burden highlighted that declines in exposures were counteracted by population growth in most regions of the world, especially sub-Saharan Africa. INTERPRETATION: Although the burden attributable to HAP has decreased considerably, HAP remains a substantial risk factor, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Our comprehensive estimates of HAP exposure and attributable burden offer a robust and reliable resource for health policy makers and practitioners to precisely target and tailor health interventions. Given the persistent and substantial impact of HAP in many regions and countries, it is imperative to accelerate efforts to transition under-resourced communities to cleaner household energy sources. Such initiatives are crucial for mitigating health risks and promoting sustainable development, ultimately improving the quality of life and health outcomes for millions of people.

10.1016/j.cell.2025.02.014	Ligand-induced ubiquitination unleashes LAG3 immune checkpoint function by	Jiang Y, Dai A, Huang Y, Li H, Cui J, Yang H, Si L, Jiao T, Ren Z, Zhang Z, Mou S, Zhu H, Guo W, Huang Q, Li Y, Xue M, Jiang J, Wang F, Li L, Zhong Q, Wang K, Liu B, Wang J, Fan G, Guo J, Chen L, Workman CJ, Shen Z, Kong Y, Vignali DAA, Xu C, Wang H	Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) has emerged as a promising cancer immunotherapy target, but the mechanism underlying LAG3 activation upon ligand engagement remains elusive. Here, LAG3 was found to undergo robust non-K48-linked polyubiquitination upon ligand engagement, which promotes LAG3&#x27;s inhibitory function instead of causing degradation. This ubiquitination could be triggered by the engagement of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) and membrane-bound (but not soluble) fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1). LAG3 ubiquitination, mediated redundantly by the E3 ligases c-Cbl and Cbl-b, disrupted the membrane binding of the juxtamembrane basic residue-rich sequence, thereby stabilizing the LAG3 cytoplasmic tail in a membrane-dissociated conformation enabling signaling. Furthermore, LAG3 ubiquitination is crucial for the LAG3-mediated suppression of antitumor immunity in vivo. Consistently, LAG3 therapeutic antibodies repress LAG3 ubiquitination, correlating with their checkpoint blockade effects. Moreover, patient cohort analyses suggest that LAG3/CBL coexpression could serve as a biomarker for response to LAG3 blockade. Collectively, our study reveals an immune-checkpoint-triggering mechanism with translational potential in cancer immunotherapy. 	Cell	06/03/2025
10.1126/sciimmunol.adm8251	DNMT1 inhibition reprograms T cells to NK-like cells with potent antitumor	Li Y, Wang J, Zhou L, Gu W, Qin L, Peng D, Li S, Zheng D, Wu Q, Long Y, Yao Y, Lin S, Sun M, Zhang X, Wang J, Liu P, Kong X, Li P	Inactivation of the transcription factor BCL11B reprograms T cells into induced-T-to-NK cells (ITNKs). However, it remains unclear how BCL11B suppresses natural killer (NK) cell transcriptional programs. Here, we identified that the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 physically interacts with BCL11B, increasing BCL11B stability and the fidelity of DNA methylation maintenance for NK cell-related genes, thereby repressing their expression. Moreover, DNMT1 maintains the epigenetic silencing of a distinct subset of NK cell-related genes independent of BCL11B. DNMT1 inhibition or depletion reprograms T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells into NK-like cells that exhibit more robust antitumor effects than BCL11B-deficient ITNKs and parental CAR-T cells. Moreover, H3K27me3 (trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27) synergizes with DNA methylation to repress NK cell-related pathways, and combined EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) and DNMT1 inhibition potentiates both the reprogramming and cytotoxicity of NK-like cells.

Based on our previous data, a multiple choice questionnaire has been developed. The aim is to perform a quantitative analysis of the results obtained from an international survey and to describe the clinical practice worldwide. Ten questions were related to participants&#x27; demographics and, 20 questions (of which 17 Likert scale questions) investigated the DMP regarding PI creation. To evaluate the tendency of the answers in the Likert-type questions, the mean of the answers obtained was compared with the mean point of the Likert scale. The survey was completed by 1019 physicians. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and distance of the anastomosis from the anal verge ≤ 10 cm were each considered alone sufficient to justify creation of a PI, with statistically significant differences in comparison to the mean point of the scales in (p =  &lt; 0.0001 in both cases). Total Mesorectal Excision alone was not considered a factor sufficient to create a PI (p = 0.416). Most of the participants agree to define their approach to create a PI &quot;tailored&quot; to patients&#x27; risk factors (p =  &lt; 0.0001) and &quot;influenced by my experience&quot; in case of patients with low/moderate risk of anastomotic leakage (p =  &lt; 0.0001). This study provides useful insights on the worldwide clinical practice regarding creation of PI following anterior resection. Given the lack of standardization and evidence-based guidelines, this analysis may be helpful to assist surgeons&#x27; practice. 	Updates in surgery	23/03/2025
10.1016/j.ahj.2025.03.009	Association between vasopressin administration and mortality in patients with	Sarma D, Smith R, Padkins M, Rali AS, Vallabhajosyula S, Khanna AK, Kashani K, Hibbert B, Jentzer JC	BACKGROUND: The utility of vasopressin as an adjunctive, catecholamine-sparing vasopressor in cardiogenic shock (CS) has not been widely examined. METHODS: We included consecutive adult patients admitted with a diagnosis of CS requiring vasopressors. High-dose vasopressors (HDV) were defined as ≥0.3 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalent. Multivariable logistic regression and propensity analysis was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values for in-hospital mortality, before and after adjustment for relevant covariates. RESULTS: We included 721 CS patients, including HDV in 32.5%. Vasopressin was administered in 207 (29%) patients within the first 24 hours. In-hospital mortality occurred in 38.1% and was higher in the HDV group (56.8% vs. 29.2%). Vasopressin was associated with lower propensity adjusted in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35-0.99, p = 0.05). Vasopressin use was also associated with lower mortality in the HDV group (unadjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32-0.92, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressin use in the first 24 hours was associated with lower adjusted mortality in patients with CS, particularly amongst those requiring HDV. The use of vasopressin in CS merits dedicated prospective evaluation. 	American heart journal	20/03/2025
10.1186/s12967-025-06357-x	Exploring the protective effect of metformin against sarcopenia: insights from	Hu Y, Lu S, Xue C, Hu Z, Wang Y, Zhang W, Wang D, Wang J, Ding G, Yu J, Hu Y, Liu Y	BACKGROUND: The impact of metformin on sarcopenia remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate whether metformin influences sarcopenia risk and evaluate the effects of potential drug targets on sarcopenia traits. METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (n = 3549) to assess the association between metformin use and sarcopenia risk in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from UK Biobank (n = 1,366,167) and FinnGen (n = 218,007), with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) as instrumental variables, examined the causal effect of metformin-related targets on sarcopenia traits, while molecular docking explored the interaction between metformin and its drug targets. RESULTS: Metformin use was associated with increased grip strength (OR = 2.46; 95% CI 1.49-2.38) and skeletal muscle mass (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 0.20-2.28), as well as reduced mortality (HR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.54-0.71). MR analysis suggested a possible link between GDF15 gene expression and sarcopenia traits, with no evidence of genetic confounding. Molecular docking indicated stable binding between metformin and GDF15. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that metformin may lower sarcopenia risk, particularly in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes, with GDF15 identified as a promising target for sarcopenia treatment.

Oncolytic viruses selectively replicate in and lyse cancer cells, releasing neoantigens and stimulating systemic antitumour immunity(3), offering a potential therapeutic option. Here we present the results of a multicentre phase 1 clinical trial evaluating VG161, an engineered oncolytic herpes simplex virus that expresses IL-12, IL-15, IL-15Rα and a PD-1-PD-L1-blocking fusion protein(4), for safety and efficacy in patients with advanced liver cancer. VG161 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities observed, and it demonstrated promising efficacy by reshaping the tumour immune microenvironment and re-sensitizing tumours that were previously resistant to systemic treatments. Notably, we also found that patients who had previously been sensitive to checkpoint inhibitor therapy showed enhanced efficacy with VG161 treatment. Furthermore, we developed an efficacy-prediction model based on differentially expressed genes, which successfully identified patients who were likely to benefit from VG161 and predicted prolonged overall survival. These findings position VG161 as a promising third-line therapeutic option for refractory hepatocellular carcinoma. This provides a new avenue for treatment and advances the field of oncolytic virus-based immunotherapies. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04806464 . 	Nature	19/03/2025

Protein abundance, turnover, and post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are key factors that determine tissue-specific proteome properties. However, these properties are challenging to study across tissues and remain poorly understood. Here, we present Turnover-PPT, a comprehensive resource mapping the abundance and lifetime of 11,000 proteins and 40,000 phosphosites in eight mouse tissues and various brain regions using advanced proteomics and stable isotope labeling. We reveal tissue-specific short- and long-lived proteins, strong correlations between interacting protein lifetimes, and distinct impacts of phosphorylation on protein turnover. Notably, we discover a remarkable pattern of turnover changes for peroxisome proteins in specific tissues and that phosphorylation regulates the stability of neurodegeneration-related proteins, such as Tau and α-synuclein. Thus, Turnover-PPT provides fundamental insights into protein stability, tissue dynamic proteotypes, and functional protein phosphorylation and is accessible via an interactive web-based portal at https://yslproteomics.shinyapps.io/tissuePPT.

10.1016/j.cmet.2025.02.009	Remote limb ischemic conditioning alleviates steatohepatitis via extracellular	Zhao Y, Gao L, Chen J, Wei J, Lin G, Hu K, Zhao W, Wei W, Huang W, Gao L, Yuan A, Qian K, Chen AF, Pu J	Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is an advanced form of liver disease with adverse outcomes. Manipulating interorgan communication is considered a promising strategy for managing metabolic disease, including steatohepatitis. Here, we report that remote limb ischemic conditioning (RIC), a clinically validated therapy for distant organ protection by transient muscle ischemia, significantly alleviated steatohepatitis in different mouse models. The beneficial effect of limb ischemic conditioning was mediated by muscle-to-liver transfer of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) and their cargo microRNAs, leading to elevation of miR-181d-5p in the liver. Hepatic miR-181d-5p overexpression faithfully mirrored the molecular and histological benefits of limb ischemic conditioning by suppressing nuclear receptor 4A3 (NR4A3). Furthermore, circulating EVs from human volunteers undergoing limb ischemic conditioning improved steatohepatitis and transcriptomic perturbations in primary human hepatocytes and animal models. Our data underscore the translational potential of limb ischemic conditioning for steatohepatitis management and extend our understanding of muscle-liver crosstalk. 	Cell metabolism	18/03/2025

If microorganisms overcome those barriers, however, innate immune cells use toxic chemicals to kill the invading cells(2,3). Here we examine immune diversity across tissues and identify a population of neutrophils in the skin that expresses a broad repertoire of proteins and enzymes needed to build the extracellular matrix. In the naive skin, these matrix-producing neutrophils contribute to the composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, reinforce its mechanical properties and promote barrier function. After injury, these neutrophils build &#x27;rings&#x27; of matrix around wounds, which shield against foreign molecules and bacteria. This structural program relies on TGFβ signalling; disabling the TGFβ receptor in neutrophils impaired ring formation around wounds and facilitated bacterial invasion. We infer that the innate immune system has evolved diverse strategies for defence, including one that physically shields the host from the outside world. 	Nature	19/03/2025

In this study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive description of the phenotypic expression, natural history, and clinical outcomes of patients with this ARVC subset. METHODS: Genetic and clinical data of DSG2 and DSC2 variant carriers were collected from 5 countries in Europe and Asia. We assessed the phenotypic profile of these patients and their clinical outcomes, focusing on heart failure and ventricular arrhythmia events. RESULTS: Overall, 271 subjects, 254 with DSG2 variants, were included in this study (median age, 38 years [interquartile range, 25-52]; 62.7% male). Of these, 165 were probands, and 200 were diagnosed with definite ARVC. A total of 181 (66.8%) individuals carried missense variants, mainly distributed in the extracellular domains. Notably, we included 78 (28.8%) individuals with multiple variants. Of the 200 cases with diagnosed ARVC, 41 (20.5%) experienced premature cardiac death before the age of 65. Among the 81 individuals for whom both left ventricular ejection fraction and right ventricular fractional area change data were available at presentation, 29 (35.8%) had isolated right ventricular dysfunction, and 16 (19.8%) had biventricular dysfunction. Single-variant carriers who engaged in intense physical exercise were younger at disease onset compared with those who did not (P=0.001). Compared with single-variant carriers, those with multiple variants were more likely to be diagnosed with ARVC (96.2% versus 64.8%; P&lt;0.001) and exhibited more severe left ventricular dysfunction (44.4% versus 22.1%; P=0.001) and right ventricular dilation (88.9% versus 55.8%, P&lt;0.001). Multiple-variant carriers were significantly younger at ARVC diagnosis compared with single-variant carriers (33 [18-49] years versus 42 [27-54] years; P&lt;0.001]. During follow-up, end-stage heart failure (P&lt;0.001) and malignant ventricular arrhythmias (P=0.004) were significantly more frequent in multiple-variant compared with single-variant carriers. Compared with PKP2 patients, DSG2/DSC2 patients exhibited a significantly higher risk of end-stage heart failure (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ARVC attributable to variants in desmosomal cadherins mostly present with right ventricular or biventricular disease. Multiple variants are common in these patients and are associated with more frequent clinical penetrance, earlier onset of disease, and adverse clinical outcomes. 	Circulation	24/03/2025

Mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) transport damaged mitochondrial components to lysosomes or the extracellular space. While many metabolites are known to modulate mitochondrial dynamics, it is largely unclear whether they are involved in MDV generation. Here, we discovered that the major component of ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), improved mitochondrial functions by facilitating the biogenesis of MDVs. Mechanistically, BHB drove specific lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) of sorting nexin-9 (SNX9), a key regulator of MDV biogenesis. Kbhb increased SNX9 interaction with inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM)/matrix proteins and promoted the formation of IMM/matrix MDVs. SNX9 Kbhb was not only critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in cells but also protected mice from alcohol-induced liver injury. Altogether, our research uncovers the fact that metabolites influence the formation of MDVs by directly engaging in post-translational modifications of key protein machineries and establishes a framework for understanding how metabolites regulate mitochondrial functions.

Zucca S, Brunori G, Dunn HA, Lankford CK, Sutton LP, Algibez Flores B, Maza NA, Sial O, Crynen G, Luján R, Martemyanov KA	Opioids trigger structural and functional neural adaptations of the reward circuit that lead to dependence. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a pivotal role in circuit organization and present prime candidates for orchestrating remodeling of neural connections in response to drug exposure. However, the contribution of CAMs to opioid-induced rewiring of the reward circuit has not been explored. Here, we used unbiased molecular profiling to identify CAMs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) modulated by morphine administration. We found that opioid exposure induces the expression of ELFN1, a CAM selectively expressed in cholinergic interneurons in the NAc. We determined that ELFN1 acts trans-synaptically to modulate the strength and plasticity of the glutamatergic inputs onto cholinergic neurons via the recruitment of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGlu4). Disruption of Elfn1 diminished morphine reward and intake in self-administering mice. Together, our findings identify a key molecular factor responsible for adjusting the strength of opioid effects by modulating the configuration of striatal circuitry in an experience-dependent fashion and unveil potential therapeutic target for combating opioid abuse.

Waltz F, Righetto RD, Lamm L, Salinas-Giegé T, Kelley R, Zhang X, Obr M, Khavnekar S, Kotecha A, Engel BD	Mitochondria regenerate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation. This process is carried out by five membrane-bound complexes collectively known as the respiratory chain, working in concert to transfer electrons and pump protons. The precise organization of these complexes in native cells is debated. We used in situ cryo-electron tomography to visualize the native structures and organization of several major mitochondrial complexes in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. ATP synthases and respiratory complexes segregate into curved and flat crista membrane domains, respectively. Respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a respirasome supercomplex, from which we determined a native 5-angstrom (Å) resolution structure showing binding of electron carrier cytochrome c. Combined with single-particle cryo-electron microscopy at 2.4-Å resolution, we model how the respiratory complexes organize inside native mitochondria. 	Science (New York, N.Y.)	21/03/2025
10.1016/j.cell.2025.02.018	Genetic protection from type 1 diabetes resulting from accelerated insulin mRNA	van Tienhoven R, O&#x27;Meally D, Scott TA, Morris KV, Williams JC, Kaddis JS, Zaldumbide A, Roep BO	Insulin gene (INS) variation and beta-cell stress are associated with the risk of development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and autoimmunity against insulin. The unfolded protein response alleviating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress involves activation of inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) that impedes translation by mRNA decay. We discover that the IRE1α digestion motif is present in insulin mRNA carrying SNP rs3842752 (G&gt;A). This SNP in the 3&#x27; untranslated region of INS associates with protection from T1D (INS(P)). ER stress in beta cells with INS(P) led to accelerated insulin mRNA decay compared with the susceptible INS variant (INS(S)). Human islets with INS(P) showed improved vitality and function and reversed diabetes more rapidly when transplanted into diabetic mice than islets carrying INS(S) only. Surrogate beta cells with INS(P) expressed less ER stress and INS-DRiP neoantigen. This explanation for genetic protection from T1D may act instead of or in concert with the previously proposed mechanism attributed to INS promoter polymorphism. 	Cell	11/03/2025

In addition, prior research is limited by small sample sizes and a failure to account for the competitive effects of other CRM diseases. METHODS: In this study, data obtained from the large-scale, prospective UK Biobank cohort were used. CRM multimorbidity was defined as the new-onset of ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease during follow-up. Multivariable Cox regression was used to analyse the independent association between TyG-BMI and each CRM multimorbidity (first, double, or triple CRM diseases). The C-statistic was calculated for each model, and a restricted cubic spline was applied to assess the dose-response relationship. A multi-state model was used to investigate the association between TyG-BMI and the trajectory of CRM multimorbidity (from baseline [without CRM disease] to the first CRM disease, the first CRM disease to double disease, and double disease to triple disease), with disease-specific analyses. RESULTS: This study included 349,974 participants, with a mean age of 56.05 (standard deviation [SD], 8.08), 55.93% of whom were female. Over a median follow-up of approximately 14 years, 56,659 (16.19%) participants without baseline CRM disease developed at least one CRM disease, including 8451 (14.92%) who progressed to double CRM disease and 789 (9.34%) who further developed triple CRM disease. In the crude model, each SD increase in TyG-BMI was associated with a 47% higher risk of the first CRM disease, a 72% higher risk of double CRM disease, and a 95% higher risk of triple CRM disease, with C-statistics of 0.625, 0.694, and 0.764, respectively. Multi-state model analysis showed a 32% increased risk of new CRM disease, a 24% increased risk of progression to double CRM disease, and a 23% increased risk of further progression for those with double CRM diseases. TyG-BMI was significantly associated with the onset of all individual first CRM diseases (except for stroke) and with the transition to double CRM disease. Significant interactions were also observed, but TyG-BMI remained significantly associated with CRM multimorbidity across subgroups. Sensitivity analyses, including varying time intervals for entering states and an expanded CRM definition (including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, obesity, and dyslipidaemia), confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: TyG-BMI remarkably influences the onset and progression of CRM multimorbidity. Incorporating it into CRM multimorbidity prevention and management could have important public health implications. 	Cardiovascular diabetology	21/03/2025
10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00024-9	Safety and efficacy of long-term gantenerumab treatment in dominantly inherited	Bateman RJ, Li Y, McDade EM, Llibre-Guerra JJ, Clifford DB, Atri A, Mills SL, Santacruz AM, Wang G, Supnet C, Benzinger TLS, Gordon BA, Ibanez L, Klein G, Baudler M, Doody RS, Delmar P, Kerchner GA, Bittner T, Wojtowicz J, Bonni A, Fontoura P, Hofmann C, Kulic L, Hassenstab J, Aschenbrenner AJ, Perrin RJ, Cruchaga C, Renton AE, Xiong C, Goate AA, Morris JC, Holtzman DM, Snider BJ, Mummery C, Brooks WS, Wallon D, Berman SB, Roberson E, Masters CL, Galasko DR, Jayadev S, Sanchez-Valle R, Pariente J, Kinsella J, van Dyck CH, Gauthier S, Hsiung GR, Masellis M, Dubois B, Honig LS, Jack CR, Daniels A, Aguillón D, Allegri R, Chhatwal J, Day G, Fox NC, Huey E, Ikeuchi T, Jucker M, Lee JH, Levey AI, Levin J, Lopera F, Roh J, Rosa-Neto P, Schofield PR	BACKGROUND: Amyloid plaque removal by monoclonal antibody therapies slows clinical progression in symptomatic Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; however, the potential for delaying the onset of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic people is unknown. The Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU) is an ongoing platform trial assessing the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational products in participants with dominantly inherited Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (DIAD). Based on findings of amyloid removal and downstream biological effects from the gantenerumab group of the platform trial, we continued a 3-year open-label extension (OLE) study to assess the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with high doses of gantenerumab. METHODS: The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2/3 multi-arm trial (DIAN-TU-001) assessed solanezumab or gantenerumab versus placebo in participants who were between 15 years before and 10 years after their estimated years to symptom onset and who had a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) global score of 0 (cognitively normal) to 1 (mild dementia). This study was followed by an OLE study of gantenerumab treatment, conducted at 18 study sites in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Puerto Rico, Spain, the UK, and the USA. For inclusion in the OLE, participants at risk for DIAD had participated in the double-blind period of DIAN-TU-001 and were required to know their mutation status. We investigated increasing doses of subcutaneous gantenerumab up to 1500 mg every 2 weeks. Due to the lack of a regulatory path for gantenerumab, the study was stopped early after a prespecified interim analysis (when most participants had completed 2 years of treatment) of the clinical measure CDR-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). The primary outcome for the final analysis was the amyloid plaque measure (11)C-Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography (PiB-PET) standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR [PiB-PET SUVR]) at 3 years, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat group (mITT; defined as participants who received any gantenerumab treatment post-OLE baseline, had at least one PiB-PET SUVR assessment before gantenerumab treatment, and a post-baseline assessment). All participants who received at least one dose of study drug in the OLE were included in the safety analysis. DIAN-TU-001 (NCT01760005) and the OLE (NCT06424236) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. FINDINGS: Of 74 participants who were recruited into the OLE study between June 3, 2020, and April 22, 2021, 73 were enrolled and received gantenerumab treatment. 47 (64%) stopped dosing due to early termination of the study by the sponsor, and 13 (18%) prematurely discontinued the study for other reasons; 13 people completed 3 years of treatment. The mITT group for the primary analysis comprised 55 participants. At the interim analysis, the hazard ratio for clinical decline of CDR-SB in asymptomatic mutation carriers was 0·79 (n=53 [95% CI 0·47 to 1·32]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab in either the double-blind or OLE period (Any Gant), and 0·53 (n=22 [0·27 to 1·03]) for participants who were treated with gantenerumab the longest (Longest Gant). At the final analysis, the adjusted mean change from OLE baseline to year 3 in PiB-PET SUVR was -0·71 SUVR (95% CI -0·88 to -0·53, p&lt;0·0001). Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities occurred in 53% (39 of 73) of participants: 47% (34 of 73) with microhaemorrhages, 30% (22 of 73) with oedema, and 6% (five of 73) were associated with superficial siderosis. No treatment-associated macrohaemorrhages or deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Partial or short-term amyloid removal did not show significant clinical effects. However, long-term full amyloid removal potentially delayed symptom onset and dementia progression. Our conclusions are limited due to the OLE design and use of external controls and need to be confirmed in long-term trials.

10.1093/ckj/sfaf057	Causal relationships between immune cell phenotypes and primary glomerular	Tang W, Li Q, Yang X, Yang H	BACKGROUND: Primary glomerular diseases (PGDs), including nephrotic syndrome (NS), membranous nephropathy (MN), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN), are complex renal conditions influenced by immune system dysregulation. Although associations between immune cell phenotypes and PGDs have been observed, the precise causal relationships have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: Utilizing genetic association data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs), we investigated 731 immunophenotypes in relation to PGDs. A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, primarily employing inverse variance weighting (IVW), was conducted to establish causality. MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode were used as complementary methods to reinforce the robustness and validity of the results. Sensitivity analyses further validated the sensitivity and stability of our results. RESULTS: We identified 38 immunophenotypes suggestively related to IgAN, with 20 as risk factors and 18 as protective effects. Six immunophenotypes remained significant after Bonferroni correction: The percentage of CD25hi among T cells; the percentage of CD25hi CD45RA(-) CD4 not T regulatory (Treg) among T cells; the percentage of CD25hi CD45RA(-) CD4 not Treg within the CD4(+) T cell population; CX3CR1 expression on monocytes; CD40 expression on monocytes; and CD64 expression on CD14(+) CD16(-) monocytes. In the validation analysis of IgAN, CD3 expression on effector memory CD4(+) T cells further confirmed the predisposing risk role of effector memory T cells in the development of IgAN. Additionally, the MR analysis demonstrated suggestive associations between 25 immunophenotypes and MN (8 risk factors and 17 protective factors), as well as between 22 immunophenotypes and NS (10 risk factors and 12 protective factors). Last, by intersecting the immunophenotypes showing suggestive associations with PGDs, we identified two common immunophenotypes shared by IgAN and MN, three by IgAN and NS, and one by MN and NS. CONCLUSIONS: This genetic-level investigation uncovers causal associations between immunophenotypes and PGDs, providing valuable insights into the immunological underpinnings of PGDs. Our findings suggest potential targets for treatment strategies, thereby facilitating more personalized and effective therapeutic approaches in PGDs management. 	Clinical kidney journal	01/03/2025
10.1007/978-1-0716-3854-5_2	Using 3-Dimensional Cultures to Propagate Genetically Modified Lung Organoids.	Chen F, Naughton KJ, Lee JH, Brainson CF	Transformed lung organoids have extensive applications in lung cancer modeling and drug screening. Traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures fail to propagate a large subpopulation of murine primary tumors in vitro. However, three-dimensional (3D) air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, which are employed to grow normal lung organoids, can be used to efficiently culture cancerous lung tumor cells. Here, we detail a procedure for cultivating genetically modified lung organoids in 3D-ALI cultures. This protocol contains two parts. The first part describes how to transduce lung epithelial cells, which are either freshly sorted from lungs or from actively growing murine organoids, with virus in order to modify gene expression. The target lung cells are incubated with virus for 1-2 h for transduction. Then, the transduced cells are thoroughly washed and mixed with stromal support cells and Matrigel and are loaded into transwell inserts for culture and validated for genetic modifications through downstream assays. The second part describes how to isolate tumor cells growing orthotopically in genetically engineered mouse models to produce organoid cell lines that can be used for ex vivo drug discovery assays. For this protocol, tumors are isolated from lungs of mice, finely chopped and washed. Then, tumor chunks are mixed with Matrigel for 3D-ALI culture. Finally, organoids budding from tumor chunks are trypsinized and passaged to establish an organoid line. Together these two protocols provide a promising platform to study the genesis, progression, and treatment of lung cancer. 	Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)	01/01/2024

Inspired by the partial resistance to TGFβ of NK cells with SMAD4 haploinsufficiency, we used CRISPR-Cas9 for knockout of SMAD4 in human NK cells. Here we show that SMAD4(KO) NK cells were resistant to TGFβ and activin A inhibition, retaining their cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion and interleukin-2/interleukin-15-driven proliferation. They showed enhanced tumor penetration and tumor growth control, both as monotherapy and in combination with tumor-targeted therapeutic antibodies. Notably, SMAD4(KO) NK cells outperformed control NK cells treated with a TGFβ inhibitor, underscoring the benefit of maintaining SMAD4-independent TGFβ signaling. SMAD4(KO) conferred TGFβ resistance across diverse NK cell platforms, including CD19-CAR NK cells, stem cell-derived NK cells and ADAPT-NK cells. These findings position SMAD4 knockout as a versatile and compelling strategy to enhance NK cell antitumor activity, providing a new avenue for improving NK cell-based cancer immunotherapies.

10.2337/dc24-2535	Association Between Diabetes and Anemia: Evidence From NHANES and the UK Biobank.	Wang D, Morton JI, Salim A, Shaw JE, Magliano DJ	OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between diabetes and anemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We included 9,026 and 389,616 participants from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys and the UK Biobank study (UKB), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the cross-sectional association of diabetes with anemia, as defined by hemoglobin measurement. For the UKB follow-up, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of incident anemia, as defined by hemoglobin levels or diagnosis records, in relation to diabetes. We further assessed the impact of inflammation, renal dysfunction, and medication use on this association in both populations. RESULTS: Among White people aged 40-69 years in the U.S. and U.K., the adjusted odds of study participants with diagnosed diabetes also having anemia was two to four times higher than in those with normal glycemia. Over a median follow-up of 13.6 years in the UKB, 42,354 people developed anemia. The adjusted HRs for incident anemia comparing diagnosed diabetes with normal glycemia were 3.05 (95% CI 2.90-3.21) for iron deficiency anemia, 3.02 (95% CI 2.51-3.63) for anemia of chronic disease, and 4.88 (95% CI 4.23-5.63) for vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. Further adjustment for inflammation, renal dysfunction, and medication use partially attenuated these associations, but they remained strong and significant. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was associated with several major types of anemia. Further studies are warranted to identify the mechanisms. 	Diabetes care	21/03/2025
10.1016/j.cmet.2025.02.008	Pyruvate metabolism enzyme DLAT promotes tumorigenesis by suppressing leucine	Wang N, Lu S, Cao Z, Li H, Xu J, Zhou Q, Yin H, Qian Q, Zhang X, Tao M, Jiang Q, Zhou P, Zheng L, Han L, Li H, Yin L, Gu Y, Dou X, Sun H, Wang W, Piao HL, Li F, Xu Y, Yang W, Chen S, Liu J	Pyruvate and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism are pivotal pathways in tumor progression, yet the intricate interplay between them and its implications for tumor progression remain elusive. Our research reveals that dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT), a pyruvate metabolism enzyme, promotes leucine accumulation and sustains mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex activation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mechanistically, DLAT directly acetylates the K109 residue of AU RNA-binding methylglutaconyl-coenzyme A (CoA) hydratase (AUH), a critical enzyme in leucine catabolism, inhibiting its activity and leading to leucine accumulation. Notably, DLAT upregulation correlates with poor prognosis in patients with HCC. Therefore, we developed an AUH(K109R)-mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) therapeutic strategy, which effectively inhibits tumor growth by restoring leucine catabolism and inhibiting mTOR activation in vivo. In summary, our findings uncover DLAT&#x27;s unexpected role as an acetyltransferase for AUH, suppressing leucine catabolism. Restoring leucine catabolism with AUH(K109R)-mRNA LNP effectively inhibits HCC development, highlighting a novel direction for cancer research. 	Cell metabolism	13/03/2025

Eriksson G, Li C, Sparovec TG, Dekanski A, Torstensson S, Risal S, Ohlsson C, Hirschberg AL, Petropoulos S, Deng Q, Stener-Victorin E	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has a negative effect on the receptivity of the endometrium to embryo implantation and increases the risk of miscarriage and endometrial cancer. The cellular and molecular heterogeneity of the endometrium in women with PCOS has not been well studied. Our study presents a comprehensive cellular atlas of the endometrium during the proliferative phase in women with PCOS characterized by overweight and obesity, hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance compared with controls of similar age, weight and body mass index. Analysis of 247,791 isolated endometrial nuclei from 27 biopsies (5 controls and 12 PCOS cases at baseline and 7 after 16 weeks of metformin and 3 after lifestyle intervention) revealed cell-type-specific disease signatures and variations in cellular composition and localization. Samples taken after 16 weeks of metformin treatment and lifestyle management showed extensive recovery of disease-specific endometrial signatures. We linked the specific role of each cell type to clinical features such as hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance, and specific cell types to risk of endometrial and metabolic disease. In addition, potential therapeutic targets such as integrin inhibitors were identified and the role of metformin in restoring endometrial health in patients with PCOS was highlighted. Our findings lay the groundwork to significantly advance the understanding of PCOS-specific endometrial dysfunction for future targeted therapies. 	Nature medicine	20/03/2025

Here, we present the Asian Immune Diversity Atlas (AIDA), a multi-national single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) healthy reference atlas of human immune cells. AIDA comprises 1,265,624 circulating immune cells from 619 donors, spanning 7 population groups across 5 Asian countries, and 6 controls. Though population groups are frequently compared at the continental level, we found that sub-continental diversity, age, and sex pervasively impacted cellular and molecular properties of immune cells. These included differential abundance of cell neighborhoods as well as cell populations and genes relevant to disease risk, pathogenesis, and diagnostics. We discovered functional genetic variants influencing cell-type-specific gene expression, which were under-represented in non-Asian populations, and helped contextualize disease-associated variants. AIDA enables analyses of multi-ancestry disease datasets and facilitates the development of precision medicine efforts in Asia and beyond. 	Cell	18/03/2025
10.1136/gutjnl-2024-333638	Endothelial-like cancer-associated fibroblasts facilitate pancreatic cancer	Sun X, Cai W, Li H, Gao C, Ma X, Guo Y, Fu D, Xiao D, Zhang Z, Wang Y, Yang S, Feng Y, Zhao T, Hao J	BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are highly heterogeneous in the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to a phenomenon in which cancer cells adopt endothelial-like characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To identify a novel protumoural CAF subtype undertaking VM. DESIGN: We used single-cell RNA sequencing and mIHC to identify FAPα(+)CD144(+) endothelial-like CAFs (endoCAFs) and combined prospective and retrospective analyses to assess its clinical outcomes. Tube formation, proliferation and invasion assay were conducted on cell lines, organoids, the orthotopic tumour model and LSL-Kras(G12D/+), LSL-Trp53(R172H/+) and Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mouse model. Mechanically, we performed cytokine array assays, RNA-sequencing, IP-mass spectrometry, ChIP and luciferase analyses. Importantly, an siRNA delivery nanosystem was developed to precisely target FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs in vivo. RESULTS: FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs were present in the tumour microenvironment of PDAC, and patients with a higher CD144(+)CAFs proportion displayed poor prognosis of PDAC. FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs not only acquired a VM phenotype to provide metastatic conduits but also promoted the proliferation and invasion of tumour cells in situ through paracrine signalling, thereby actively facilitating the metastasis of tumour cells. The CD144-β-catenin-STAT3 signalling axis was activated, and CD144 and downstream secreted cytokines were transcriptionally upregulated to maintain the dual roles of endoCAFs. A CAF-targeting siRNA delivery nanosystem, via loading FAPα and siCD144, was administered to precisely target FAPα(+)CD144(+) endoCAFs, which substantially inhibited their protumoural roles in vivo. CONCLUSION: FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs can promote metastasis of PDAC via undertaking VM and paracrine through activation of the CD144-β-catenin-STAT3 signalling axis. CAF-targeting siRNA delivery nanosystem can inhibit tumour progression by precisely targeting FAPα(+)CD144(+)endoCAFs. 	Gut	23/03/2025
10.1038/s41422-025-01098-4	Nociceptor neurons promote PDAC progression and cancer pain by interaction with	Wang K, Ni B, Xie Y, Li Z, Yuan L, Meng C, Zhao T, Gao S, Huang C, Wang H, Ma Y, Zhou T, Feng Y, Chang A, Yang C, Yu J, Yu W, Zang F, Zhang Y, Ji RR, Wang X, Hao J	The emerging field of cancer neuroscience has demonstrated great progress in revealing the crucial role of the nervous system in cancer initiation and progression. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by perineural invasion and modulated by autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic) and sensory innervations. Here, we further demonstrated that within the tumor microenvironment of PDAC, nociceptor neurons interacted with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) through calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and nerve growth factor (NGF). This interaction led to the inhibition of interleukin-15 expression in CAFs, suppressing the infiltration and cytotoxic function of natural killer (NK) cells and thereby promoting PDAC progression and cancer pain. In PDAC patients, nociceptive innervation of tumor tissue is negatively correlated with the infiltration of NK cells while positively correlated with pain intensity. This association serves as an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival and relapse-free survival for PDAC patients. Our findings highlight the crucial regulation of NK cells by nociceptor neurons through interaction with CAFs in the development of PDAC. We also propose that targeting nociceptor neurons or CGRP signaling may offer a promising therapy for PDAC and cancer pain. 	Cell research	24/03/2025

Furthermore, research on the underlying mechanisms has mostly been limited to laboratory and animal models, with few large-scale population-based studies. METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021, we analyzed disability-adjusted life years and mortality for CVD attributable to APMP (measured as particulate matter [PM](2.5)) from 1990 to 2021. We examined shifts in burden between APMP and household air pollution (HAP), regional disparities by socio-demographic index (SDI), and predicted trends using a Bayesian age-period-cohort model. Additionally, we used UK Biobank (UKB) data (metabolomics: 230,000 + participants; proteomics: 50,000 +) to identify biomarkers mediating the association between PM(2.5) exposure and CVD outcomes, and further analyzed their biological roles. Metabolic and proteomic signatures were constructed using regression and elastic net models, with predictive performance assessed via time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis. Life expectancy was evaluated using flexible parametric survival models. Subgroup analysis was conducted by age, sex, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and genetic susceptibility. RESULTS: In 2021, the global CVD absolute burden attributable to APMP was more than double that of 1990, with significant regional disparities. The burden shifted from HAP to APMP, with 15% of CVD cases globally attributed to APMP. The CVD burden attributable to APMP increased with age and is projected to rise through 2030. In the UKB, approximately 30 metabolites, including albumin, mediated the association between PM(2.5) exposure and CVD outcomes, primarily involving lipid and fatty acids metabolism. Over 60 proteins, including growth differentiation factor-15 and trefoil factor 2, mediated the association with CVD outcomes, enriched in cytokine-receptor interaction and leukocyte migration pathways. Metabolic and proteomic signatures outperformed PM(2.5) alone in predicting 1-, 5-, and 10-year CVD outcomes. Participants in the lowest decile of PM(2.5) exposure, metabolic, and proteomic signatures had longer life expectancy than those in the highest decile. CONCLUSION: The CVD burden attributable to APMP remains a critical public health concern. This study presents a novel approach for identifying and managing susceptible populations through metabolomic and proteomic perspectives. 	Journal of translational medicine	22/03/2025
10.1097/ALN.0000000000005460	Suzetrigine, a Non-Opioid NaV1.8 Inhibitor for Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe	Bertoch T, D&#x27;Aunno D, McCoun J, Solanki D, Taber L, Urban J, Oswald J, Swisher MW, Tian S, Miao X, Correll DJ, Negulescu P, Bozic C, Weiner SG	BACKGROUND: Opioids are effective for treating acute pain but have safety, tolerability, and addiction concerns while non-opioid analgesics have limited efficacy. Suzetrigine, an oral, non-opioid, small molecule, selectively inhibits the voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (NaV1.8) and has potential to provide efficacious and safe relief for acute pain, without addiction concerns. METHODS: To evaluate suzetrigine for treatment of acute pain, we conducted two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trials in adults with moderate-to-severe acute pain on the verbal categorical rating scale and ≥4 on the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) after abdominoplasty (N=1118) or bunionectomy (N=1073). After surgery, participants were randomized to suzetrigine (100mg then 50mg every 12hrs), hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen (HB/APAP; 5/325mg every 6hrs), or placebo for 48 hours. The primary endpoint was time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference in NPRS from 0-48hrs (SPID48) versus placebo. Key secondary endpoints were SPID48 versus HB/APAP and time to ≥2-point reduction in NPRS from baseline versus placebo. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was achieved in both trials with suzetrigine demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in pain versus placebo. The least squares mean difference in SPID48 between suzetrigine and placebo was 48.4 (95%CI:33.6,63.1;P&lt;0.0001) after abdominoplasty and 29.3 (95%CI:14.0,44.6; P=0.0002) after bunionectomy. Neither trial achieved the first key secondary endpoint of superiority of suzetrigine versus HB/APAP on SPID48. For the second key secondary endpoint of time to ≥2-point reduction in NPRS, suzetrigine had a more rapid onset of clinically meaningful pain relief versus placebo after abdominoplasty (119min versus 480mins, nominal P&lt;0.0001) and bunionectomy (240mins versus 480mins, nominal P=0.0016).Adverse events (AEs) were similar to those seen in post-surgical settings. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with placebo, suzetrigine reduced moderate-to-severe acute pain over 48 hours after abdominoplasty or bunionectomy. Pain reduction with suzetrigine was similar to that with HB/APAP. Suzetrigine was associated with adverse events that were mild to moderate in severity.

10.1016/S2468-2667(25)00044-1	Three decades of population health changes in Japan, 1990-2021: a subnational		BACKGROUND: Given Japan&#x27;s rapidly ageing demographic structure, comprehensive and long-term evaluations of its national and subnational health progress are important to inform public health policy. This study aims to assess Japan&#x27;s population health, using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to analyse the country&#x27;s evolving disease patterns. METHODS: GBD 2021 used Japanese data from 1474 sources, covering 371 diseases, including COVID-19, and 88 risk factors. The analysis included estimates of life expectancy, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Estimates were generated using the standardised GBD methodology, which incorporates various data sources through statistical modelling, including the Cause Of Death Ensemble Model for mortality, Bayesian Meta-Regression Disease Model for non-fatal outcomes, and risk factor estimation frameworks to quantify attributable burdens. Life expectancy decomposition by cause of death and annualised rates of change of age-standardised mortality and DALYs were calculated for 1990-2005, 2005-15, and 2015-21. FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2021, life expectancy in Japan rose from 79·4 years (95% uncertainty interval 79·3-79·4) to 85·2 years (85·1-85·2), with prefecture-level disparities widening. Gains were primarily driven by reduced mortality from stroke (adding 1·5 years to life expectancy), ischaemic heart disease (1·0 years), and neoplasms, particularly stomach cancer (0·5 years), with variation across prefectures. Leading causes of death in 2021 were Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other dementias (135·3 deaths [39·5-312·3] per 100 000 population), stroke (114·9 [89·8-129·3] per 100 000), ischaemic heart disease (96·5 [77·7-106·7] per 100 000), and lung cancer (72·1 [61·8-77·5] per 100 000). Age-standardised mortality for major non-communicable diseases declined, but the pace of this decline has slowed. All-cause annualised rate of change in mortality rate decreased from -1·6% for 2005-15 to -1·1% for 2015-21. Age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rates were 0·8 deaths (0·7-0·9) per 100 000 population (accounting for 0·3% of all deaths) in 2020 and 3·0 (2·5-3·7) per 100 000 population in 2021 (1·0% of deaths). Age-standardised DALY rates for diabetes worsened, with annualised rate of change increasing from 0·1% for 2005-15 to 2·2% for 2015-21. This change parallels worsening trends in major risk factors, particularly high fasting plasma glucose (annualised rate of change of attributable DALYs -0·8% for 2005-15 and 0·8% for 2015-21) and high BMI (0·2% and 1·4%, respectively). Age-standardised DALYs attributable to other major risk factors continued to decrease, albeit slower. INTERPRETATION: Japan&#x27;s health gains over the past 30 years are now stalling, with rising regional disparities. The increasing burdens of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other dementias and diabetes, alongside high fasting plasma glucose and high BMI, highlight areas needing focused attention and action.

We aimed to investigate whether active surveillance could be an alternative for individuals with a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial in 12 Dutch hospitals. Individuals with locally advanced oesophageal cancer and a clinical complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (ie, no tumour detected with endoscopic biopsies, ultrasound, and PET-CT) underwent active surveillance or standard surgery (ie, oesophagectomy within 2 weeks after reaching clinical complete response). There were no inclusion restrictions regarding comorbidities or performance status, but participants had carcinoma, were age 18 years or older, and were treated with curative intent. Randomisation of hospitals was performed using computer-generated sequences without stratification methods, after an initial phase of all hospitals performing standard surgery. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed according to a modified intention-to-treat principle (allowing crossover at time of clinical complete response) and an intention-to-treat principle. Non-inferiority was defined as 2-year survival rate for active surveillance of 15% or less below that for standard surgery. The trial was registered within the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR-6803, and the inclusion phase has been completed. FINDINGS: Between Nov 8, 2017, and Jan 17, 2021, 1115 individuals were screened, of whom 309 were included. 198 underwent active surveillance and 111 underwent standard surgery. 242 (78%) participants were male and 67 (22%) were female. Median follow-up was 38 months (IQR 32-48). 2-year overall survival for active surveillance (74% [95% CI 69-78]) was non-inferior to standard surgery (71% [62-78]) after modified intention-to-treat analysis (one-sided 95% boundary: 7% lower). It remained non-inferior in the intention-to-treat analysis (75% [68-80] vs 70% [63-77], one-sided 95% boundary: 6% lower). There were no significant differences in overall survival according to modified intention-to-treat analysis (hazard ratio 1·14, two-sided 95% CI 0·74-1·78) or intention-to-treat analysis (0·83, 0·53-1·31). The frequency of postoperative complications and postoperative mortality after standard surgery or postponed surgery after active surveillance was similar between groups. INTERPRETATION: Overall survival after active surveillance for oesophageal cancer was non-inferior compared with standard surgery after 2 years. For the long-term efficacy of active surveillance, extended follow-up is required. The results of the present trial could be used for patient counselling and shared decision making.

Parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase renowned for mitochondrial quality control, has emerged as a regulator of immune response. Here, we show that both systemic and macrophage-specific ablations of Parkin in mice lead to attenuated tumor progression and prolonged mouse survival. By single-cell RNA-seq and flow cytometry, we demonstrate that Parkin deficiency reshapes the TIME through activating both innate and adaptive immunities to control tumor progression and recurrence. Mechanistically, Parkin activation by AMP-activated protein kinase rather than PTEN-induced kinase 1 mediated major histocompatibility complex I down-regulation on macrophages via Autophagy related 5-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, Parkin deletion synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade treatment and Park2(-/-) signature aids in predicting the prognosis of patients with solid tumor. Our findings uncover Parkin&#x27;s involvement in suppressing macrophage antigen presentation for coordinating the cross-talk between macrophages and T cells. 	Science advances	21/03/2025
10.1038/s41586-025-08757-x	Spatially resolved mapping of cells associated with human complex traits.	Song L, Chen W, Hou J, Guo M, Yang J	Depicting spatial distributions of disease-relevant cells is crucial for understanding disease pathology(1,2). Here we present genetically informed spatial mapping of cells for complex traits (gsMap), a method that integrates spatial transcriptomics data with summary statistics from genome-wide association studies to map cells to human complex traits, including diseases, in a spatially resolved manner. Using embryonic spatial transcriptomics datasets covering 25 organs, we benchmarked gsMap through simulation and by corroborating known trait-associated cells or regions in various organs. Applying gsMap to brain spatial transcriptomics data, we reveal that the spatial distribution of glutamatergic neurons associated with schizophrenia more closely resembles that for cognitive traits than that for mood traits such as depression. The schizophrenia-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the dorsal hippocampus, with upregulated expression of calcium signalling and regulation genes, whereas depression-associated glutamatergic neurons were distributed near the deep medial prefrontal cortex, with upregulated expression of neuroplasticity and psychiatric drug target genes.

10.1038/s41467-025-58189-4	Mitochondria transplantation transiently rescues cerebellar neurodegeneration	Li SJ, Zheng QW, Zheng J, Zhang JB, Liu H, Tie JJ, Zhang KL, Wu FF, Li XD, Zhang S, Sun X, Yang YL, Wang YY	Cerebellar ataxia is the primary manifestation of cerebellar degenerative diseases, and mitochondrial dysfunction in Purkinje cells (PCs) plays a critical role in disease progression. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of mitochondria transplantation as a potential therapeutic approach to rescue cerebellar neurodegeneration and elucidate the associated mechanisms. We constructed a conditional Drp1 knockout model in PCs (PCKO mice), characterized by progressive ataxia. Drp1 knockout resulted in pervasive and progressive apoptosis of PCs and significant activation of surrounding glial cells. Mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggers mitophagy, is a key pathogenic factor contributing to morphological and functional damage in PCs. Transplanting liver-derived mitochondria into the cerebellum of 1-month-old PCKO mice improved mitochondrial function, reduced mitophagy, delayed apoptosis of PCs, and alleviated cerebellar ataxia for up to 3 weeks. These findings demonstrate that mitochondria transplantation holds promise as a therapeutic approach for cerebellar degenerative diseases. 	Nature communications	22/03/2025
10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-24-0747	Colorectal Tumors in Diverse Patient Populations Feature a Spectrum of Somatic	Matejcic M, Teer JK, Hoehn HJ, Diaz DB, Shankar K, Gong J, Nguyen NT, Loroña NC, Coppola D, Fulmer CG, Saglam O, Jiang K, Cress WD, Muñoz-Antonia T, Flores I, Gordián ER, Oliveras Torres JA, Felder SI, Sanchez J, Fleming JB, Siegel EM, Freedman JA, Dutil J, Stern MC, Fridley BL, Figueiredo JC, Schmit SL	Ancestrally diverse and admixed populations, including the Hispanic/Latino/a/x/e community, are underrepresented in cancer genetic/genomic studies. Leveraging the Latino Colorectal Cancer Consortium (LC3) and other existing datasets, we analyzed whole exome sequencing data on tumor/normal pairs from 718 individuals with colorectal cancer to map somatic mutational features by ethnicity and genetic similarity. Global proportions of African, Asian, European, and Native American genetic ancestries were estimated using ADMIXTURE. Associations between these proportions and somatic mutational features were examined using logistic regression. APC, TP53, and KRAS were the top three mutated genes across all participants and in the subset of Latino individuals in LC3. In analyses examining recurrently mutated genes, tumors from patients of Latino ethnicity had fewer KRAS and PIK3CA mutations compared to tumors from non-Latino patients. Genetic ancestry overall was associated with CDC27 mutation status, and African genetic ancestry was associated with SMAD2 mutation status. In exome-wide analyses, African genetic ancestry was significantly associated with higher odds of mutation in KNCN and TMEM184B. Native American genetic ancestry was associated with a lower frequency of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors. The SBS11 mutational signature was associated with Native American genetic ancestry as well as Latino ethnicity. In an independent replication dataset, MSK-IMPACT, estimates of association were largely consistent in direction, but non-significant. A meta-analysis of LC3 and MSK-IMPACT showed that African genetic ancestry was significantly associated with KRAS mutation status and MSI status. This work facilitates precision medicine initiatives by providing insights into the contribution of genetic ancestry to molecular features of colorectal tumors. 	Cancer research	24/03/2025
10.1080/13691058.2014.894206	Basic deprivation and involvement in risky sexual behaviour among out-of-school	Kunnuji M	Research has shown that in countries such as Nigeria many urban dwellers live in a state of squalour and lack the basic necessities of food, clothing and shelter. The present study set out to examine the association between forms of basic deprivation--such as food deprivation, high occupancy ratio as a form of shelter deprivation, and inadequate clothing--and two sexual outcomes--timing of onset of penetrative sex and involvement in multiple sexual partnerships. The study used survey data from a sample of 480 girls resident in Iwaya community. A survival analysis of the timing of onset of sex and a regression model for involvement in multiple sexual partnerships reveal that among the forms of deprivation explored, food deprivation is the only significant predictor of the timing of onset of sex and involvement in multiple sexual partnerships. The study concludes that the sexual activities of poor out-of-school girls are partly explained by their desire to overcome food deprivation and recommends that government and non-governmental-organisation programmes working with young people should address the problem of basic deprivation among adolescent girls.

10.1038/s41586-025-08678-9	A polyene macrolide targeting phospholipids in the fungal cell membrane.	Deng Q, Li Y, He W, Chen T, Liu N, Ma L, Qiu Z, Shang Z, Wang Z	The global spread of multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungi presents a serious threat to human health, necessitating the discovery of antifungals with unique modes of action(1). However, conventional activity-based screening for previously undescribed antibiotics has been hampered by the high-frequency rediscovery of known compounds and the lack of new antifungal targets(2). Here we report the discovery of a polyene antifungal antibiotic, mandimycin, using a phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery platform. Mandimycin is biosynthesized by the mand gene cluster, has evolved in a distinct manner from known polyene macrolide antibiotics and is modified with three deoxy sugars. It has demonstrated potent and broad-spectrum fungicidal activity against a wide range of multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens in both in vitro and in vivo settings. In contrast to known polyene macrolide antibiotics that target ergosterol, mandimycin has a unique mode of action that involves targeting various phospholipids in fungal cell membranes, resulting in the release of essential ions from fungal cells. This unique ability to bind multiple targets gives it robust fungicidal activity as well as the capability to evade resistance. The identification of mandimycin using the phylogeny-guided natural-product discovery strategy represents an important advancement in uncovering antimicrobial compounds with distinct modes of action, which could be developed to combat multidrug-resistant fungal pathogens.

We aimed to establish novel comprehensive evaluation scales for cachexia specific to patients with solid tumours. METHODS: This study included 12 651 patients (males: 6793 [53.7%]; females: 5858 [46.3%]; medium age: 58 [interquartile range:50/66] years; medium follow-up duration: 24.16 [13.32/44.84] months; 4271 [33.8%] patients died; mean survival: 55.53 [95% confidence interval, 54.87/56.10] months; 3344 [26.4%], 4184 [33.1%] and 5123 [40.5%] patients with Stage I-II, III and IV tumour, respectively; derivation set: 10022, validation set: 2629 patients) with 14 types of solid tumours, including lung, gastric, liver, breast, oesophageal, cervical, bladder, pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal and endometrial carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, from an open and ongoing multicentre cohort study in China. Risk factors for cachexia, including tumour characteristics and nutritional parameters, were examined to develop diagnostic scales using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Ten nutrition items (body mass index, weight loss, intake reduction, physical activity function, fatigue, handgrip strength, anorexia, albumin level, albumin/globulin ratio and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) with different weighted scores were identified to construct a nutrition-weighted scoring scale (NWSS) for nutrition risk. Tumour type and tumour burden status (tumour-node-metastasis stage and radical or non-radical tumour) were determined to construct a disease-weighted scoring scale (DWSS) for disease risk. A lumped scale (5 × 5 matrix) established using a five-grade classification of nutrition and disease risk was used to determine a five-grade classification of comprehensive cachexia risk: A, no cachexia risk (reference; lowest disease and nutrition risks); B, cachexia risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.517 [4.033/5.058]); C, pre-cachexia (HR = 9.755 [8.73/10.901], medium survival = 21.21 months); D, cachexia (HR = 16.901 [14.995/19.049], medium survival = 11.61 months); and E, refractory cachexia (HR = 31.879 [28.244/35.981], medium survival = 4.83 months, highest disease and nutrition risks) (p &lt; 0.001). Patients in Categories A-D benefited from nutrition therapy and anti-tumour treatments to varying degrees. Patients in Category E were clinically refractory to nutrition therapy without prolonged survival compared with patients without nutrition therapy (medium survival, pre-hospitalization nutrition therapy vs. hospitalization nutrition therapy vs. without nutrition therapy, 2.89 [1.91/3.88] vs. 4.04 [3.21/4.88] vs. 5.89 [4.73/7.04] months, p = 0.015) and anti-tumour treatments without prolonged survival compared with patients receiving palliative care (medium survival, radical anti-tumour treatments vs. adjuvant anti-tumour treatments vs. palliative anti-tumour treatments vs. and palliative care, 6.48 [4.42/8.53] vs. 6.48 [3.23/9.73] vs. 4.83 [4.22/5.44] vs. 2.70 [1.09/4.30] months, p = 0.263). CONCLUSION: We systematically developed a novel definition and grading diagnostic criteria for tumour-type-specific comprehensive cancer cachexia risk.

10.1002/ctm2.70244	HIF-1α-induced long noncoding RNA LINC02776 promotes drug resistance of ovarian	Wu Y, Zeng Y, Wu Y, Ha X, Feng Z, Liu C, Liu Z, Wang J, Ju X, Huang S, Liang L, Zheng B, Yang L, Wang J, Wu X, Li S, Wen H	BACKGROUND: Chemoresistance remains a major hurdle in ovarian cancer (OC) treatment, as many patients eventually develop resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and/or PARP inhibitors (PARPi). METHODS: We performed transcriptome-wide analysis by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of platinum-resistant and -sensitive OC tissues. We demonstrated the role of LINC02776 in platinum resistance in OC cells, mice models and patient-derived organoid (PDO) models. RESULTS: We identify the long noncoding RNA LINC02776 as a critical factor of platinum resistance. Elevated expression of LINC02776 is observed in platinum-resistant OC and serves as an independent prognostic factor for OC patients. Functionally, silencing LINC02776 reduces proliferation and DNA damage repair in OC cells, thereby enhancing sensitivity to platinum and PARPi in both xenograft mouse models and patient-derived organoid (PDO) models with acquired chemoresistance. Mechanistically, LINC02776 binds to the catalytic domain of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), promoting PARP1-dependent polyADP-ribosylation (PARylation) and facilitating homologous recombination (HR) restoration. Additionally, high HIF-1α expression in platinum-resistant tissues further stimulates LINC02776 transcription. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that targeting LINC02776 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for OC patients who have developed resistance to platinum or PARPi. KEY POINTS: LINC02776 promotes OC cell proliferation by regulating DNA damage and apoptosis signaling pathways. LINC02776 binds PARP1 to promote DNA damage-triggered PARylation in OC cells. LINC02776 mediates cisplatin and olaparib resistance in OC cells by enhancing PARP1-mediated PARylation activity and regulating the PARP1-mediated HR pathway. The high expression of LINC02776 is induced by HIF-1α in platinum-resistant OC cells and tissues. 	Clinical and translational medicine	01/03/2025
10.1093/cid/ciaf132	Paucibacillary tuberculosis drives the low positive predictive value of Xpert	Cuella-Martin I, Hakizayezu F, Ahmed A, Runyambo D, Niyompano H, Keysers J, De Rijk WB, Mulders W, Mitchell EMH, Decroo T, Habimana YM, Migambi P, Muvunyi CM, de Jong BC, Rigouts L, Ngabonziza JCS	BACKGROUND: Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) aimed to improve the specificity in identifying rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB), compared to Xpert MTB/RIF. METHODS: In a nationwide study in Rwanda, patients diagnosed with RR-TB by Ultra between December 2021 and January 2024 underwent repeat Ultra testing, complemented by rpoB gene sequencing and phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing (pDST), serving as reference tests. RESULTS: Of 129 patients initially diagnosed with RR-TB by Ultra, only 41 (32%) had concordant rifampicin results upon repeat Ultra testing. The remaining 88 patients (68%) had unconfirmed resistance on repeat Ultra. Reference testing was available for 40 (98%) of 41 confirmed cases, all verified as true RR-TB. Among 88 unconfirmed cases, reference testing was available for 61 (69%), with seven (11%) confirmed as true RR-TB, while 54 (89%) were found to have rifampicin-susceptible TB. Notably, 89% of 55 patients with very low bacillary loads on their initial Ultra had false RR-TB results, a significantly higher risk of false resistance compared to other bacillary load categories combined (risk ratio: 8.20; 95% CI: 3.56-18.85; p&lt;0.001). Consequently, 53% (54/101) of initial RR patients with available reference testing received unnecessary RR-TB treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Ultra represents a valuable tool for rapid RR-TB detection, however, in low prevalence settings its low positive predictive value for RR detection is largely driven by samples with very low bacillary loads. As programs expand active case-finding and early detection of asymptomatic disease, the proportion of TB detected with very low bacillary load will increase. Diagnostic algorithms require adjustments to prevent unnecessary RR-TB treatment. 	Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases	22/03/2025

Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the temporal cortex from APOE2 carriers, APOE3 homozygotes, and APOE4 carriers, we found that AD-associated transcriptomic changes were highly APOE genotype dependent. Comparing AD with controls, APOE2 carriers showed upregulated synaptic and myelination-related pathways, preserving synapses and myelination at the protein level. Conversely, these pathways were downregulated in APOE3 homozygotes, resulting in reduced synaptic and myelination proteins. In APOE4 carriers, excitatory neurons displayed reduced synaptic pathways similar to APOE3, but oligodendrocytes showed upregulated myelination pathways like APOE2. However, their synaptic and myelination protein levels remained unchanged or increased. APOE4 carriers also showed increased pro-inflammatory signatures in microglia but reduced responses to amyloid-β pathology. These findings reveal APOE genotype-specific molecular alterations in AD across cell types. 	Neuron	11/03/2025
10.1053/j.gastro.2025.02.035	Machine learning and artificial intelligence in the multi-omics approach to gut	Rozera T, Pasolli E, Segata N, Ianiro G	The gut microbiome is involved in human health and disease, and its comprehensive understanding is necessary to exploit it as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool. Multi-omics approaches, including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics, and metaproteomics, enable depicting the complexity of the gut microbial ecosystem. However, these tools generate a large data stream, which integration is needed to produce clinically useful readouts but, in turn, might be difficult to carry out with conventional statistical methods. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been increasingly applied to multi-omics datasets in several conditions associated with microbiome disruption, from chronic disorders to cancer. Such tools show potential for clinical implementation, including the discovery of microbial biomarkers for disease classification or prediction, the prediction of response to specific treatments, the fine-tuning of microbiome-modulating therapies. Here we discuss the state of the art, potential, and limits, of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the multi-omics approach to gut microbiome. 	Gastroenterology	19/03/2025
10.1186/s12887-025-05592-x	Validity and reliability of the European health literacy child form in Turkish	Altunoz I, Aygun O	PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the European Health Literacy Scale Child Form in Turkish children and to examine the instrument&#x27;s psychometric properties. DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 843 students aged 9-11 years in primary and secondary school were included in this scale adaptation study. In the validity analyses of the Health Literacy Scale Child Form-Turkish form (HLS-Child-Q15-TR), language and content validity were used to determine cultural compatibility, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were used in structural analyses. Reliability was investigated by examining internal consistency and test-retest reliability. RESULTS: The content validity of the HLS-Child-Q15-TR was found to be high. The model fit values of the confirmatory factor analysis results of the three-factor model consisting of health care, disease prevention and health promotion dimensions of the HLS-Child-Q15-TR were found to be satisfactory (x2/df = 2.68, CFI = 0.945, GFI = 0.965, and RMSEA = 0.045). HLS-Child-Q15-TR item-total correlations were above 0.30 and Cronbach&#x27;s alpha coefficient was 0.831. The test-retest correlation coefficient of the HLS-Child-Q15-TR was 0.98 and stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: HLS-Child-Q15-TR is valid and reliable in Turkish children aged 9-11 years. It is recommended that the valid and reliable HLS-Child-Q15-TR be used to measure the health literacy levels of Turkish children under 12 years of age. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: HLS-Child-Q15-TR valid and reliable instrument for use with Turkish children aged 9-11 years. HLS-Chıld-Q15-TR will make an important contribution to the Turkish culture in evaluating the health literacy levels of children 9-11 years age in Turkey. 	BMC pediatrics	22/03/2025
10.1016/j.arr.2025.102739	Fluid-based biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.	Cao Y, Xu Y, Cao M, Chen N, Zeng Q, Lai MKP, Fan D, Sethi G, Cao Y	Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease (AD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson&#x27;s Disease (PD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are increasingly prevalent as global populations age. Fluid biomarkers, derived from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, saliva, urine, and exosomes, offer a promising solution for early diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring. These biomarkers can reflect critical pathological processes like amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, α-syn misfolding, TDP-43 mislocalization and aggregation, and neuronal damage, enabling detection long before clinical symptoms emerge. Recent advances in blood-based biomarkers, particularly plasma Aβ, phosphorylated tau, and TDP-43, have shown diagnostic accuracy equivalent to CSF biomarkers, offering more accessible testing options. This review discusses the current challenges in fluid biomarker research, including variability, standardization, and sensitivity issues, and explores how combining multiple biomarkers with clinical symptoms improves diagnostic reliability. Ethical considerations, future directions involving extracellular vehicles (EVs), and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are also highlighted. Continued research efforts will be key to overcoming these obstacles, enabling fluid biomarkers to become crucial tools in personalized medicine for neurodegenerative diseases.

Kuzuoglu-Ozturk D, Nguyen HG, Xue L, Figueredo E, Subramanyam V, Liu I, Bonitto K, Noronha A, Dabrowska A, Cowan JE, Oses-Prieto JA, Burlingame AL, Worland ST, Carroll PR, Ruggero D	Tuning protein expression by targeting RNA structure using small molecules is an unexplored avenue for cancer treatment. To understand whether this vulnerability could be therapeutically targeted in the most lethal form of prostate cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), we use a clinical small molecule, zotatifin, that targets the RNA helicase and translation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A). Zotatifin represses tumorigenesis in patient-derived and xenograft models and prolonged survival in vivo alongside hormone therapy. Genome-wide transcriptome, translatome, and proteomic analysis reveals two important translational targets: androgen receptor (AR), a key oncogene in CRPC, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1A (HIF1A), an essential cancer modulator in hypoxia. We solve the structure of the 5&#x27; UTRs of these oncogenic mRNAs and strikingly observe complex structural remodeling of these select mRNAs by this small molecule. Remarkably, tumors treated with zotatifin become more sensitive to anti-androgen therapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, &quot;translatome therapy&quot; provides additional strategies to treat the deadliest cancers. 	Cancer cell	18/03/2025
10.1002/rcm.8668	Quantification of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid from microbiome	Fritz-Wallace K, Engelmann B, Krause JL, Schäpe SS, Pöppe J, Herberth G, Rösler U, Jehmlich N, von Bergen M, Rolle-Kampczyk U	RATIONALE: Glyphosate is one of the most widely used herbicides and it is suspected to affect the intestinal microbiota through inhibition of aromatic amino acid synthesis via the shikimate pathway. In vitro microbiome bioreactors are increasingly used as model systems to investigate effects on intestinal microbiota and consequently methods for the quantitation of glyphosate and its degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in microbiome model systems are required. METHODS: An optimized protocol enables the analysis of both glyphosate and AMPA by simple extraction with methanol:acetonitrile:water (2:3:1) without further enrichment steps. Glyphosate and AMPA are separated by liquid chromatography on an amide column and identified and quantified with a targeted tandem mass spectrometry method using a QTRAP 5500 system (AB Sciex). RESULTS: Our method has a limit of detection (LOD) in extracted water samples of &lt;2 ng/mL for both glyphosate and AMPA. In complex intestinal medium, the LOD is 2 and 5 ng/mL for glyphosate and AMPA, respectively. These LODs allow for measurement at exposure-relevant concentrations. Glyphosate levels in a bioreactor model of porcine colon were determined and consequently it was verified whether AMPA was produced by porcine gut microbiota. CONCLUSIONS: The method presented here allows quantitation of glyphosate and AMPA in complex bioreactor fluids and thus enables studies of the impact of glyphosate and its metabolism on intestinal microbiota. In addition, the extraction protocol is compatible with an untargeted metabolomics analysis, thus allowing one to look for other perturbations caused by glyphosate in the same sample.

10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00109-6	Calcitonin gene-related peptide-targeted therapy in migraine: current role and	Versijpt J, Paemeleire K, Reuter U, MaassenVanDenBrink A	Almost 40 years ago, the discovery of the vasoactive neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its role in migraine pathophysiology ushered in a new era in migraine treatment. Since 2018, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are available for migraine prevention. The approval of these drugs marks a pioneering development, as they are the first pharmacological agents specifically tailored for migraine prevention. Introduction of these agents contrasts the historical reliance on traditional preventive medications initially formulated for other indications and later repurposed for migraine therapy. Although the emergence of evidence on the efficacy and safety of CGRP-targeted mAbs has raised the bar for treatment success in migraine, their efficacy in other headache entities, such as cluster headache, is low to moderate. Small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists called gepants have also been proven to be effective both as acute and preventive migraine treatments. Furthermore, these agents have bridged the traditional categories of acute and preventive treatment strategies. Short-term prevention and treatment during the prodromal phase of migraine represent emerging strategies enabling clinicians to develop treatment approaches designed to meet changing patient needs; however, these strategies still require more formal evidence. Although solid data have been gathered, further research concerning the efficacy and long-term safety of drugs targeting the CGRP pathway and robust pharmacoeconomic evaluations are needed. Finally, randomised withdrawal and switching studies would facilitate the formulation of evidence-based guidance for the discontinuation of and switching between drugs targeting the CGRP pathway.

Using three-dimensional electron microscopy, we performed nanoscale reconstructions of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 pathway after chemogenetic labeling of cellular ensembles recruited during associative learning. Neurons with a remote history of activity coinciding with memory acquisition showed no strong preference for wiring with each other. Instead, their connectomes expanded through multisynaptic boutons independently of the coactivation state of postsynaptic partners. The rewiring of ensembles representing an initial engram was accompanied by input-specific, spatially restricted upscaling of individual synapses, as well as remodeling of mitochondria, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and interactions with astrocytes. Our findings elucidate the physical hallmarks of long-term memory and offer a structural basis for the cellular flexibility of information coding. 	Science (New York, N.Y.)	21/03/2025

Here, we investigated macrophage responses to monosodium urate crystals, calcium pyrophosphate crystals, aluminum salts, and silica nanoparticles. While each particle induced a distinct gene expression pattern, we identified a common inflammatory signature and acute activation of lysosomal acidification genes. Using monosodium urate crystals as a model, we demonstrated that this lysosomal gene program is regulated by a 5&#x27;-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent transcriptional network, including TFEB, TFE3, and the epigenetic regulators DNA methyl transferase 3a (DNMT3A) and DOT1L. This lysosomal acidification program operates in parallel with, but largely independently of, a JNK-AP-1-dependent network driving crystal-induced chemokine and cytokine expression. These findings reveal a bifurcation in pathways governing inflammatory and lysosomal responses, offering insights for treating particle-associated diseases. 	Immunity	19/03/2025
10.1161/JAHA.124.039751	Impact of DNA-Methylation Age Acceleration on Long-Term Mortality Among US Adults	Wu S, Zhu J, Lyu S, Wang J, Shao X, Zhang H, Zhong Z, Liu H, Zheng L, Chen Y	BACKGROUND: The association between DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAmAA) and cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome stages and long-term mortality in the population with CKM syndrome remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: This cohort study included 1889 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002) with CKM stages and DNA methylation age data. DNAmAA was calculated as residuals from the regression of DNA methylation age on chronological age. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, with cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality as secondary outcomes. Proportional odds models assessed the associations between DNAmAAs and CKM stages, and Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated the associations between DNAmAAs and mortality. Significant associations were found between DNAmAAs and advanced CKM stages, particularly for GrimAge2Mort acceleration (GrimAA) (odds ratio [OR], 1.547 [95% CI, 1.316-1.819]). Over an average follow-up of 14 years, 1015 deaths occurred. Each 5-unit increase in GrimAA was associated with a 50% increase in all-cause mortality (95% CI, 1.39-1.63), a 77% increase in cardiovascular mortality (95% CI, 1.46-2.15), and a 42% increase in noncardiovascular mortality (95% CI, 1.27-1.59). With the lowest GrimAA tertile as a reference, the highest GrimAA tertile showed hazard ratios of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.56-2.45) for all-cause mortality, 3.06 (95% CI, 2.13-4.40) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.65 (95% CI, 1.20-2.29) for noncardiovascular mortality. Mediation analysis indicated that GrimAA mediates the association between various exposures (including physical activity, Healthy Eating Index-2015 score, hemoglobin A1c, etc.) and mortality.

10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102031	Cerebrospinal fluid proteomics identification of biomarkers for amyloid and tau	Wang Z, Chen Y, Gong K, Zhao B, Ning Y, Chen M, Li Y, Ali M, Timsina J, Liu M, Cruchaga C, Jia J	Accurate staging of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) pathology is crucial for therapeutic trials and prognosis, but existing fluid biomarkers lack specificity, especially for assessing tau deposition severity, in amyloid-beta (Aβ)-positive patients. We analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 136 participants in the Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using more than 6,000 proteins. We apply machine learning to predict AD pathological stages defined by amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET). We identify two distinct protein panels: 16 proteins, including neurofilament heavy chain (NEFH) and SPARC-related modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), that distinguished Aβ-negative/tau-negative (A-T-) from A+ individuals and nine proteins, such as HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), that differentiated A+T+ from A+T- stages. These signatures outperform the established CSF biomarkers (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.92 versus 0.67-0.70) and accurately predicted disease progression over a decade. The findings are validated in both internal and external cohorts. These results underscore the potential of proteomic-based signatures to refine AD diagnostic criteria and improve patient stratification in clinical trials. 	Cell reports. Medicine	12/03/2025

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate thromboembolic and major bleeding events and all-cause death following OAC discontinuation and characteristics associated with patient prognoses after successful CA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included patients without AF recurrence or adverse events 12 months after CA among those undergoing their first CA between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2021. The study population was divided into groups according to the continuation and discontinuation of OACs at the landmark period of 12 months after CA. Follow-up data were acquired until December 31, 2023, and the study analysis was conducted from January to April 2024. EXPOSURES: OAC discontinuation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were thromboembolic and major bleeding events and all-cause death after 12 months. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and propensity score-matched analyses were used to adjust baseline characteristics. RESULTS: This study included 1821 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.6 [11.7] years; 1339 men [73.5%]). Overall, 922 patients (50.6%) continued OAC for 12 months, whereas 899 (49.4%) discontinued OAC. During a mean (SD) follow-up of 4.8 (4.0) years, thromboembolic events, major bleeding events, and death occurred in 43 (2.4%), 41 (2.3%), and 71 (3.9%) patients, respectively. After IPTW adjustment, the OAC discontinuation group demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of thromboembolism (incidence rate, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.45-1.35] vs 0.37 [95% CI, 0.22-0.54] per 100 person-years; log-rank P = .04) and a lower incidence of major bleeding (incidence rate, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.02-0.19] vs 0.65 [95% CI, 0.43-0.90] per 100 person-years; log-rank P &lt; .001) than in the continuation group. In a subgroup analysis, OAC discontinuation was associated with a higher risk of thromboembolism in patients with asymptomatic AF, left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 60%, and left atrial diameter of 45 mm or greater. In contrast, OAC discontinuation was beneficial for reducing major bleeding risks in patients with a HAS-BLED score of 2 or greater. These outcomes were similar in the propensity score-matched analysis using 1100 paired matched patients, except for insignificant differences in thromboembolic events. Differences in mortality between the 2 groups were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this retrospective cohort study, discontinuation of OACs after successful CA was associated with increased thromboembolic events and decreased bleeding events. The benefits of discontinuing OACs were stratified according to specific characteristics, pending a future prospective randomized study. 	JAMA network open	03/03/2025
10.1016/j.xgen.2025.100810	Cross-ancestry analyses of Chinese and European populations reveal insights into	Lin C, Xia M, Dai Y, Huang Q, Sun Z, Zhang G, Luo R, Peng Q, Li J, Wang X, Lin H, Gao X, Tang H, Shen X, Wang S, Jin L, Hao X, Zheng Y	Differential susceptibilities to various diseases and corresponding metabolite variations have been documented across diverse ethnic populations, but the genetic determinants of these disparities remain unclear. Here, we performed large-scale genome-wide association studies of 171 directly quantifiable metabolites from a nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics platform in 10,792 Han Chinese individuals. We identified 15 variant-metabolite associations, eight of which were successfully replicated in an independent Chinese population (n = 4,480). By cross-ancestry meta-analysis integrating 213,397 European individuals from the UK Biobank, we identified 228 additional variant-metabolite associations and improved fine-mapping precision. Moreover, two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses revealed evidence that genetically predicted levels of triglycerides in high-density lipoprotein were associated with a higher risk of coronary artery disease and that of glycine with a lower risk of heart failure in both ancestries. These findings enhance our understanding of the shared and specific genetic architecture of metabolites as well as their roles in complex diseases across populations. 	Cell genomics	19/03/2025
10.1016/j.cell.2025.02.027	Microtubules in Asgard archaea.	Wollweber F, Xu J, Ponce-Toledo RI, Marxer F, Rodrigues-Oliveira T, Pössnecker A, Luo ZH, Malit JJL, Kokhanovska A, Wieczorek M, Schleper C, Pilhofer M	Microtubules are a hallmark of eukaryotes. Archaeal and bacterial homologs of tubulins typically form homopolymers and non-tubular superstructures. The origin of heterodimeric tubulins assembling into microtubules remains unclear. Here, we report the discovery of microtubule-forming tubulins in Asgard archaea, the closest known relatives of eukaryotes. These Asgard tubulins (AtubA/B) are closely related to eukaryotic α/β-tubulins and the enigmatic bacterial tubulins BtubA/B. Proteomics of Candidatus Lokiarchaeum ossiferum showed that AtubA/B were highly expressed. Cryoelectron microscopy structures demonstrate that AtubA/B form eukaryote-like heterodimers, which assembled into 5-protofilament bona fide microtubules in vitro. The additional paralog AtubB2 lacks a nucleotide-binding site and competitively displaced AtubB. These AtubA/B2 heterodimers polymerized into 7-protofilament non-canonical microtubules. In a sub-population of Ca. Lokiarchaeum ossiferum cells, cryo-tomography revealed tubular structures, while expansion microscopy identified AtubA/B cytoskeletal assemblies. Our findings suggest a pre-eukaryotic origin of microtubules and provide a framework for understanding the fundamental principles of microtubule assembly. 	Cell	19/03/2025

We report here a preplanned analysis in the previously reported APPLE study, a phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy of the bevacizumab in combination with atezolizumab, plus platinum chemotherapy in metastatic, nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We investigated the correlation of serum VEGF-A and its isoforms at baseline with treatment response by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We reveal that the addition of bevacizumab significantly improves the progression-free survival in patients with the low VEGF-A level. Our results demonstrate that measuring serum VEGF-A or its isoforms may identify NSCLC patients who are likely to benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to immunotherapy. These assays are easy to measure and have significant potential for further clinical development. 	Nature communications	22/03/2025
10.1038/s43018-025-00937-y	Palmitoylation of GPX4 via the targetable ZDHHC8 determines ferroptosis	Zhou L, Lian G, Zhou T, Cai Z, Yang S, Li W, Cheng L, Ye Y, He M, Lu J, Deng Q, Huang B, Zhou X, Lu D, Zhi F, Cui J	Ferroptosis is closely linked with various pathophysiological processes, including aging, neurodegeneration, ischemia-reperfusion injury, viral infection and, notably, cancer progression; however, its post-translational regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here we revealed a crucial role of S-palmitoylation in regulating ferroptosis through glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a pivotal enzyme that mitigates lipid peroxidation. We identified that zinc finger DHHC-domain containing protein 8 (zDHHC8), an S-acyltransferase that is highly expressed in multiple tumors, palmitoylates GPX4 at Cys75. Through small-molecule drug screening, we identified PF-670462, a zDHHC8-specific inhibitor that promotes the degradation of zDHHC8, consequently attenuating GPX4 palmitoylation and enhancing ferroptosis sensitivity. PF-670462 inhibition of zDHHC8 facilitates the CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell-induced ferroptosis of tumor cells, thereby improving the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in a B16-F10 xenograft model. Our findings reveal the prominent role of the zDHHC8-GPX4 axis in regulating ferroptosis and highlight the potential application of zDHHC8 inhibitors in anticancer therapy. 	Nature cancer	19/03/2025
10.1055/s-2007-971124	Physiological effects of variations in spontaneously chosen crank rate during	Marais G, Weissland T, Robin H, Vanvelcenaher JM, Lavoie JM, Pelayo P	The aim of the present study was to compare the physiological responses when the crank rate was chosen spontaneously (Ts) or set at +/- 10% (T-10%, T+10%) of the freely chosen rate, during two upper body exercises: i) a sub-maximal test (T(SUB)) in which intensities ranged from 50 to 80% (118.4 +/- 10.2 to 189.5 +/- 16.3 watts) of maximal power (MP) and ii) a supramaximal test (T(SUPRA)) in which power output was set at 110 and 120% (260.5 +/- 22.4 and 284.2 +/- 24.4 watts) of MP. Eight nationally and internationally ranked kayakers, aged 20 +/- 2 years, performed these tests in which power outputs were normalised in relation to the maximal power output determined during T(MP). In T(SUB+10%), oxygen uptake and ventilation were significantly (P&lt; 0.05) higher than during T(SUBxS). In T(SUB+10%) and T(SUB-10%), energy expenditure was significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher and gross and net efficiencies lower than during T(SUBxS). During T(SUPRA-10%) when the power output was set at 110% of MP, time to exhaustion was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) than during T(SUPRAxS). The findings of the present study suggest that upper body exercise performed on an ergocycle should be conducted using the freely and spontaneously chosen crank rate.

However, it remains unknown whether targeting CCR2, the cognate receptor of CCL2, provides protection against human atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Computationally predicted damaging or loss-of-function (REVEL &gt; 0.5) variants within CCR2 were detected in whole-exome-sequencing data from 454,775 UK Biobank participants and tested for association with cardiovascular endpoints in gene-burden tests. Given the key role of CCR2 in monocyte mobilization, variants associated with lower monocyte count were prioritized for experimental validation. The response to CCL2 of human cells transfected with these variants was tested in migration and cAMP assays. Validated damaging variants were tested for association with cardiovascular endpoints, atherosclerosis burden, and vascular risk factors. Significant associations were replicated in six independent datasets (n = 1,062,595). RESULTS: Carriers of 45 predicted damaging or loss-of-function CCR2 variants (n = 787 individuals) were at lower risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. One of these variants (M249K, n = 585, 0.15% of European ancestry individuals) was associated with lower monocyte count and with both decreased downstream signaling and chemoattraction in response to CCL2. While M249K showed no association with conventional vascular risk factors, it was consistently associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR]: 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54-0.81, p = 6.1 × 10(-5)) and coronary artery disease (OR: 0.74, 95%CI: 0.63-0.87, p = 2.9 × 10(-4)) in the UK Biobank and in six replication cohorts. In a phenome-wide association study, there was no evidence of a higher risk of infections among M249K carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of an experimentally confirmed damaging CCR2 variant are at a lower lifetime risk of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease without carrying a higher risk of infections. Our findings provide genetic support for the translational potential of CCR2-targeting as an atheroprotective approach. 	Genome medicine	21/03/2025
10.1186/s12889-025-22231-3	Exploring the nonlinear association between cardiometabolic index and	Zhou H, Mao Y, Ye M, Zuo Z	BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a prevalent chronic disease affecting over 1.2 billion people worldwide, representing a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The Waist-to-Height Ratio (WHtR) and Triglyceride to High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio are established metabolic indicators linked to the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Recently, a Cardiometabolic Index (CMI), combining WHtR and TG/HDL-C ratios, has been proposed to provide a comprehensive assessment of metabolic health. This study investigates the association between CMI and hypertension using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS: The study utilized NHANES data from nine cycles spanning 2001 to 2018, encompassing 20,049 participants aged over 20. Exclusions were made for individuals with incomplete CMI or hypertension data, and pregnant women. CMI was calculated by multiplying the WHtR by the TG/HDL-C ratio. Hypertension was defined according to American Heart Association guidelines. The relationship between CMI and hypertension was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analyses, with additional subgroup analyses conducted based on demographic factors. Nonlinear relationships were analyzed using smoothing curve fitting techniques. RESULTS: The study identified a significant positive correlation between CMI and hypertension risk, with an increase of one unit in CMI associated with a 9% heightened risk of hypertension (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.13). The association remained significant across various demographic subgroups. A nonlinear relationship was observed, with a critical CMI threshold of 2.64. Below this threshold, higher CMI values were associated with a progressively higher prevalence of hypertension, whereas beyond this threshold, further increases in CMI did not significantly correlate with an elevated risk of hypertension. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that CMI is significantly associated with hypertension risk and may serve as a valuable tool for early screening and risk assessment, particularly in identifying individuals at higher risk before reaching the critical CMI threshold. These results underscore the importance of addressing metabolic health in the prevention and management of hypertension. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to establish causality, explore the clinical utility of CMI in hypertension screening, and examine its applicability in diverse populations.

Here, we integrate prospective isolation of human skeletal stem cells (hSSCs; CD45(-)CD235a(-)TIE2(-)CD31(-)CD146(-)PDPN(+)CD73(+)CD164(+)) from ten skeletal sites with functional assays and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to identify chondrogenic, osteogenic, stromal, and fibrogenic subtypes of hSSCs during development and their linkage to skeletal phenotypes. We map the distinct composition of hSSC subtypes across multiple skeletal sites and demonstrate their unique in vivo clonal dynamics. We find that age-related changes in bone formation and regeneration disorders stem from a pathological fibroblastic shift in the hSSC pool. Utilizing a Boolean algorithm, we uncover gene regulatory networks that dictate differences in the ability of hSSCs to generate specific skeletal tissues. Importantly, hSSC lineage dynamics are pharmacologically malleable, providing a new strategy to treat aberrant hSSC diversity central to aging and skeletal maladies. 	Cell stem cell	19/03/2025
10.1016/S1474-4422(25)00033-X	Advances in diagnosis, classification, and management of pain in Parkinson&#x27;s	Tinazzi M, Gandolfi M, Artusi CA, Bannister K, Rukavina K, Brefel-Courbon C, de Andrade DC, Perez-Lloret S, Mylius V	With over 10 million people affected worldwide, Parkinson&#x27;s disease is the fastest-growing neurological disorder. More than two-thirds of people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease live with chronic pain, which can manifest in various stages of the disease, substantially affecting daily activities and quality of life. The Parkinson&#x27;s disease Pain Classification System overcomes the limitations of previous classification systems by distinguishing between pain related to Parkinson&#x27;s disease and unrelated pain, while also incorporating clinical and pathophysiological (mechanistic) descriptors such as nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain. This system provides a framework for accurate diagnosis and mechanism-based therapy. Alongside the appropriate classification of pain, consideration of treatment approaches that include non-invasive (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) and invasive strategies tailored to specific types of pain will refine and inform research trials and clinical practice when it comes to treating pain in Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest that gastric cancer screening or surveillance in asymptomatic individuals over 80 should be discontinued or not started, and that patients&#x27; comorbidities should be considered when treatment of superficial lesions is planned.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that a high quality endoscopy including the use of virtual chromoendoscopy (VCE), after proper training, is performed for screening, diagnosis, and staging of precancerous conditions (atrophy and intestinal metaplasia) and lesions (dysplasia or cancer), as well as after endoscopic therapy. VCE should be used to guide the sampling site for biopsies in the case of suspected neoplastic lesions as well as to guide biopsies for diagnosis and staging of gastric precancerous conditions, with random biopsies to be taken in the absence of endoscopically suspected changes. When there is a suspected early gastric neoplastic lesion, it should be properly described (location, size, Paris classification, vascular and mucosal pattern), photodocumented, and two targeted biopsies taken.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP do not recommend routine performance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT prior to endoscopic resection unless there are signs of deep submucosal invasion or if the lesion is not considered suitable for endoscopic resection.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for differentiated gastric lesions clinically staged as dysplastic (low grade and high grade) or as intramucosal carcinoma (of any size if not ulcerated or ≤ 30 mm if ulcerated), with EMR being an alternative for Paris 0-IIa lesions of size ≤ 10 mm with low likelihood of malignancy.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest that a decision about ESD can be considered for malignant lesions clinically staged as having minimal submucosal invasion if differentiated and ≤ 30 mm; or for malignant lesions clinically staged as intramucosal, undifferentiated and ≤ 20 mm; and in both cases with no ulcerative findings.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommends patient management based on the following histological risk after endoscopic resection: Curative/very low-risk resection (lymph node metastasis [LNM] risk &lt; 0.5 %-1 %): en bloc R0 resection; dysplastic/pT1a, differentiated lesion, no lymphovascular invasion, independent of size if no ulceration and ≤ 30 mm if ulcerated. No further staging procedure or treatment is recommended.Curative/low-risk resection (LNM risk &lt; 3 %): en bloc R0 resection; lesion with no lymphovascular invasion and: a) pT1b, invasion ≤ 500 µm, differentiated, size ≤ 30 mm; or b) pT1a, undifferentiated, size ≤ 20 mm and no ulceration. Staging should be completed, and further treatment is generally not necessary, but a multidisciplinary discussion is required. Local-risk resection (very low risk of LNM but increased risk of local persistence/recurrence): Piecemeal resection or tumor-positive horizontal margin of a lesion otherwise meeting curative/very low-risk criteria (or meeting low-risk criteria provided that there is no submucosal invasive tumor at the resection margin in the case of piecemeal resection or tumor-positive horizontal margin for pT1b lesions [invasion ≤ 500 µm; well-differentiated; size ≤ 30 mm, and VM0]). Endoscopic surveillance/re-treatment is recommended rather than other additional treatment. High-risk resection (noncurative): Any lesion with any of the following: (a) a positive vertical margin (if carcinoma) or lymphovascular invasion or deep submucosal invasion (&gt; 500 µm from the muscularis mucosae); (b) poorly differentiated lesions if ulceration or size &gt; 20 mm; (c) pT1b differentiated lesions with submucosal invasion ≤ 500 µm with size &gt; 30 mm; or (d) intramucosal ulcerative lesion with size &gt; 30 mm. Complete staging and strong consideration for additional treatments (surgery) in multidisciplinary discussion.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP suggest the use of validated endoscopic classifications of atrophy (e. g. Kimura-Takemoto) or intestinal metaplasia (e. g. endoscopic grading of gastric intestinal metaplasia [EGGIM]) to endoscopically stage precancerous conditions and stratify the risk for gastric cancer.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that biopsies should be taken from at least two topographic sites (2 biopsies from the antrum/incisura and 2 from the corpus, guided by VCE) in two separate, clearly labeled vials. Additional biopsy from the incisura is optional.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that patients with extensive endoscopic changes (Kimura C3 + or EGGIM 5 +) or advanced histological stages of atrophic gastritis (severe atrophic changes or intestinal metaplasia, or changes in both antrum and corpus, operative link on gastritis assessment/operative link on gastric intestinal metaplasia [OLGA/OLGIM] III/IV) should be followed up with high quality endoscopy every 3 years, irrespective of the individual&#x27;s country of origin.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that no surveillance is proposed for patients with mild to moderate atrophy or intestinal metaplasia restricted to the antrum, in the absence of endoscopic signs of extensive lesions or other risk factors (family history, incomplete intestinal metaplasia, persistent H. pylori infection). This group constitutes most individuals found in clinical practice.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend H. pylori eradication for patients with precancerous conditions and after endoscopic or surgical therapy.ESGE/EHMSG/ESP recommend that patients should be advised to stop smoking and low-dose daily aspirin use may be considered for the prevention of gastric cancer in selected individuals with high risk for cardiovascular events.

10.1186/s12967-025-06378-6	CHI3L1 mediates radiation resistance in colorectal cancer by inhibiting	Jin M, Liu H, Zheng Z, Fang S, Xi Y, Liu K	BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is a key treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly rectal cancer; however, many patients are resistant to radiation. While it has been shown that CHI3L1 is associated with CRC progression, its specific function and regulatory mechanisms in radiation resistance remain unclear. METHODS: The levels of CHI3L1 in CRC and normal tissue samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. To assess the effects of CHI3L1 on CRC cell proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell assays were performed. Radiation resistance in CRC cells with varying CHI3L1 expression levels was evaluated through colony formation assay. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses were conducted to explore the correlation between CHI3L1 and p53 expression levels. Ferroptosis was assessed by determining reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) concentrations in cells with different CHI3L1 expression levels, and a xenograft mouse model was used to identify the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis in vivo. RESULTS: Significant CHI3L1 upregulated was observed in CRC tissues and was associated with promotion of malignant cell behaviors. The number of colonies in CHI3L1-overexpressing groups was significantly greater than that in the control groups following radiation, indicating increased radiation resistance in the former group. Furthermore, CHI3L1 overexpression was associated with p53 downregulation and elevated p53 ubiquitination. Notably, CHI3L1 inhibited the ferroptosis of CRC cells by suppressing p53 expression through the p53/SLC7A11 signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: CHI3L1 overexpression promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion, and radiation resistance of CRC cells. Elevated CHI3L1 expression is associated with increased p53 ubiquitination and SLC7A11 upregulation. CHI3L1 promotes radiation resistance by suppressing ferroptosis in CRC cells through the p53/SLC7A11 axis. 	Journal of translational medicine	21/03/2025
10.1038/s41392-025-02176-0	The BCL2 family: from apoptosis mechanisms to new advances in targeted therapy.	Vogler M, Braun Y, Smith VM, Westhoff MA, Pereira RS, Pieper NM, Anders M, Callens M, Vervliet T, Abbas M, Macip S, Schmid R, Bultynck G, Dyer MJ	The B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein family critically controls apoptosis by regulating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. In this cutting-edge review, we summarize the basic biology regulating the BCL2 family including canonical and non-canonical functions, and highlight milestones from basic research to clinical applications in cancer and other pathophysiological conditions. We review laboratory and clinical development of BH3-mimetics as well as more recent approaches including proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and tools targeting the BH4 domain of BCL2. The first BCL2-selective BH3-mimetic, venetoclax, showed remarkable efficacy with manageable toxicities and has transformed the treatment of several hematologic malignancies. Following its success, several chemically similar BCL2 inhibitors such as sonrotoclax and lisaftoclax are currently under clinical evaluation, alone and in combination. Genetic analysis highlights the importance of BCL-X(L) and MCL1 across different cancer types and the possible utility of BH3-mimetics targeting these proteins. However, the development of BH3-mimetics targeting BCL-X(L) or MCL1 has been more challenging, with on-target toxicities including thrombocytopenia for BCL-X(L) and cardiac toxicities for MCL1 inhibitors precluding clinical development. Tumor-specific BCL-X(L) or MCL1 inhibition may be achieved by novel targeting approaches using PROTACs or selective drug delivery strategies and would be transformational in many subtypes of malignancy. Taken together, we envision that the targeting of BCL2 proteins, while already a success story of translational research, may in the foreseeable future have broader clinical applicability and improve the treatment of multiple diseases.

10.1182/blood.2024026236	Clonal hematopoiesis is clonally unrelated to multiple myeloma and is associated	Lionetti M, Scopetti M, Matera A, Maeda A, Marella A, Lazzaroni F, Castellano G, Fabris S, Pioggia S, Lonati S, Marchetti A, Cattaneo A, Tornese M, Neri A Dr, Leoni C, Pettine L, Traini V, Silvestris I, Barbieri M, Fabbiano G, Ronchetti D, Taiana E, De Magistris C, Da Via&#x27; MC, Passamonti F, Bolli N	Multiple myeloma (MM) initiation is dictated by genomic events. However, its progression from asymptomatic stages to an aggressive disease that ultimately fails to respond to treatments is also dependent on changes of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a prevalent clonal condition of the hematopoietic stem cell whose presence is causally linked to a more inflamed microenvironment. Here, we show in 106 patients with MM that CHIP is frequently co-existing with MM at diagnosis, associates with a more advanced R-ISS stage, higher age and shows a non-significant trend towards lower median hemoglobin. In our cohort the two conditions do not share a clonal origin. Single cell RNA-sequencing in 16 MM patients highlights significant TME changes when CHIP is present: decreased naïve T cells, a pro-inflammatory TME, decreased antigen-presenting function by dendritic cells and expression of exhaustion markers in CD8 cells. Inferred interactions between cell types in CHIP-positive TME suggested that especially monocytes, T cells and clonal plasma cells may have a prominent role in mediating inflammation, immune evasion and pro-survival signals in favor of MM cells. Altogether, our data show that, in the presence of CHIP, the TME of MM at diagnosis is significantly disrupted in line with what usually seen in more advanced disease, with potential translational implications. Our data highlight the relevance of this association and prompt for further studies on the modifier role of CHIP in the MM TME. 	Blood	20/03/2025
10.1016/j.ymthe.2025.03.029	Combined AAV-mediated specific Gjb2 expression restores hearing in DFNB1 mouse	Sun Q, Tan F, Zhang L, Lu Y, Wei H, Li N, Jiang L, Zhou Y, Chen T, Lu L, Li GL, Qi J, Yang S, Chai R	Pathogenic mutations in the Gjb2 gene, encoding connexin 26, are the leading cause of autosomal-recessive hereditary deafness. Gene therapy holds significant promise for treating this. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated therapeutic gene delivery has been shown to be safe and effective in restoring hearing in both animal models and human patients. However, Gjb2 gene therapy has been hindered by the limited specificity and efficiency of the available AAV vectors. In this study, we screened AAV serotypes and found that co-administration of AAV1 and AAV-ie could effectively target Gjb2-expressing cells. However, the ectopic Gjb2 expression in hair cells induced by these AAVs could cause ototoxicity, which was addressed by employing the specific promoter SCpro. Co-injection of AAV1 and AAV-ie carrying exogenous Gjb2 driven by SCpro effectively restored hearing function in Gjb2-deficient mice. Moreover, the combined AAV system can transduce the cochleae of Bama miniature pigs and AAV administration into the inner ear of cynomolgus monkeys did not impair hearing and showed negligible systemic toxicity, indicating the efficiency and safety of this gene therapy in large animals. Thus, this study provides a strategy for Gjb2 gene therapy and lays a foundation for future clinical applications. 	Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy	21/03/2025

Wnt2, secreted by liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC), activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote hepatocyte proliferation after injury. To address the dual challenges of targeted delivery and phagocytosis evasion, we develop a combined &quot;eat me/don&#x27;t eat me&quot; strategy. RLTRKRGLK (RLTR) peptide-functionalized exosomes are engineered by inserting DMPE-PEG2000-CRLTRKRGLK into the lipid membrane of exosome derived from bEnd.3 cell. Surface-displayed RLTR mediates exosomal enrichment in LSEC, while CD47 engineering reduces macrophage clearance via &quot;don&#x27;t eat me&quot; signaling. Then, lentiviral transfection enables stable encapsulation of functional Wnt2 mRNA into Exo(CD47) (designated Wnt2@Exo(CD47)). In both acetaminophen (APAP) and dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)-induced murine liver injury models, RLTR-Wnt2@Exo(CD47) demonstrates LSEC-specific targeting and significant hepatoprotection. This engineered exosome platform provides a therapeutic strategy for DILI. 	Cell reports. Medicine	14/03/2025

However, whether lactate influences the biogenesis of tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs), the prerequisite for distant metastasis formation, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that extracellular lactate, after taken up by tumor cells via lactate transporter MCT1, drove the release of TDE mainly through facilitating multivesicular body (MVB) trafficking towards plasma membrane instead of lysosome. Mechanistically, lactate promoted p300-mediated Rab7A lactylation, which hereafter inhibited its GTPase activity and promoted MVB docking with plasma membrane. Moreover, lactate administration enriched integrin β4 and ECM remodeling-related proteins in TDE cargos, which promoted pulmonary pre-metastatic niche formation. Combinatorial inhibition of MCT1 and p300 significantly abrogated HCC metastasis in a clinical-relevant PDX model. In summary, we demonstrated that lactate promote TDE biogenesis and HCC pulmonary metastasis, and proposed a potential clinical strategy targeting TDEs to prevent HCC metastasis.

10.1210/clinem/dgaf187	Continuous glucose monitoring improves detection of glycemic excursions in	Galindo RJ, Moazzami B, Gerges A, Flores I, Arevalo G, Peng L, Tuttle KR, Umpierrez GE	BACKGROUND: Optimal glucose management in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on hemodialysis is challenging. We compared the detection of glycemic excursions with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and capillary glucose testing (CBG) in this population. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, insulin-treated adults with T2D on hemodialysis for ≥90 days wore a Dexcom G6-Pro CGM. Participants were instructed to perform CBG up to 4 times daily. We compared differences in glucose metrics and described CGM patterns in relation to dialysis sessions. RESULTS: Among 59 participants (age 57. 7±9years, HbA1c 7.09%), mean glucose measured by CBG and CGM was 165.7 ± 41.8 and 188.9 ± 45.0, with a time-in-range (TIR) of 68%±23 and 51%±26, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). CGM detected that all participants had hyperglycemic episodes of 180mg/dL, with time-above-range (TAR) 180mg/dL of 47.8%±27, and 90% had episodes of &gt;250mg/dL, with TAR &gt;250mg/dL of 20.9%±21.7. CGM detected higher rates of hypoglycemia &lt;70mg/dL, (47% vs. 25%, p=0.005) and &lt;54mg/dL, (25% vs. 12%, p=0.08) than CBG testing. Nocturnal and prolonged hypoglycemia &lt;70mg/dL were only detected by CGM (29% and 12%, respectively). CGM showed a pattern of improved glucose levels on pre-dialysis days, lower glucose levels during hemodialysis, and a rapid rise during the post-dialysis period. CONCLUSIONS: In participants with T2D and ESKD on hemodialysis, CGM improved the detection of hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events, particularly nocturnal and prolonged episodes. CGM revealed distinct glycemic patterns related to dialysis sessions, potentially enabling more personalized management. 	The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism	22/03/2025
10.1186/s13195-024-01657-8	Accelerometer-derived &quot;weekend warrior&quot; physical activity, sedentary behavior,	Ning Y, Chen M, Yang H, Jia J	BACKGROUND: Research has shown that sedentary behavior (SB) may increase dementia risk, but it remains unclear whether concentrated moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) can compensate such negative effects. This study aimed to explore the association between different MVPA patterns combined with SB time and the risk of dementia. METHODS: This prospective study used data from the UK Biobank cohort, which provided accelerometer-based physical activity data for a full week from February 2013 to December 2015. Participants were categorized into &quot;weekend warriors (WW)&quot; group, engaged in more than 50% MVPA (≥ 150 min/week) on 1 to 2 days; inactive group (total MVPA &lt; 150 min/week); and regular group, who met the recommended MVPA (≥ 150 min/week) but not WW. The participants were further divided into six groups based on SB duration (≥ 8.52 h/day or &lt; 8.52 h/day). A multivariable Cox model was used to assess the relationship between these patterns and the risk of dementia, adjusted by age, gender, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, education level, employment status, alcohol consumption, smoking, BMI, and baseline comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes). RESULTS: We included 91,948 participants without dementia at baseline. During a median follow-up of 7.93 years, 736 participants developed all-cause dementia. When the MVPA threshold was set at 150 min per week, 16,149 participants (17.5%) were classified as WW with long SB, 19,055 (20.7%) as regular with long SB, and 21,909 (23.8%) as inactive with long SB. Compared to inactive and long SB time, the WW group showed a reduction in dementia risk (WW with long SB time: HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.87, P = 0.002; WW with short SB time: HR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.97, P = 0.029). And regular group with shorter SB time was associated with a lower dementia risk (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.96, P = 0.021), but not in the group with longer SB time. CONCLUSIONS: The WW pattern may help mitigate the dementia risk associated with prolonged SB, suggesting that the quality and intensity of physical activity are also important factors.

10.1016/j.eururo.2025.02.023	European Association of Urology Guidelines on Upper Urinary Tract Urothelial	Masson-Lecomte A, Birtle A, Pradere B, Capoun O, Compérat E, Domínguez-Escrig JL, Liedberg F, Makaroff L, Mariappan P, Moschini M, Rai BP, van Rhijn BWG, Shariat SF, Smith EJ, Teoh JYC, Soukup V, Wood R, Xylinas EN, Soria F, Seisen T, Gontero P	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We present a summary of the 2025 update for the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). The aim is to provide practical recommendations on the clinical management of UTUC with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. METHODS: For the 2025 guidelines on UTUC, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Key recommendations emphasise the importance of thorough diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for patients with UTUC. The guidelines stress the importance of appropriate treatment taking into account patient values and preferences. Key updates in the 2025 UTUC guidelines include: significant changes to the recommendations for UTUC diagnosis; complete revision of the sections addressing risk stratification, ureteroscopy, and the surgical approach for radical nephroureterectomy; addition of four new recommendations, two related to kidney-sparing management of localised low-risk UTUC and a further two related to management of high-risk nonmetastatic UTUC; a review and adaptation of recommendation for UTUC follow-up; and addition of a new section addressing quality indicators for UTUC management. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This overview of the 2025 EAU guidelines on UTUC offers valuable insights into risk factors, diagnosis, classification, treatment, and follow-up for UTUC. The guidelines contain information on the management of individual patients according to the current best evidence and are designed for effective integration in clinical practice.

10.1038/s41467-025-57988-z	Dynamic ctDNA tracking stratifies relapse risk for triple negative breast cancer	Li S, Li Y, Wei W, Gong C, Wang T, Li G, Yao F, Ou JH, Xu Y, Wu W, Jin L, Rao N, Nie Y, Yu F, Jia W, Li XR, Zhang J, Yang HW, Yang Y, Wu M, Li Q, Li F, Gong Y, Yi X, Liu Q	Early Triple negative breast cancer (eTNBC) is the subtype with the worst outcome. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is shown to predict the prognosis of breast cancer, but its utility in eTNBC remains unclear. 130 stage II-III female eTNBC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have been enrolled prospectively and subjected to ctDNA analysis. ctDNA at post-NAC (pre-surgery) and post-surgery, but not at baseline, is associated with worse prognosis. A threshold of 1.1% maximum variant allele frequency at baseline stratifies patients with different relapse risk, which is validated internally and externally. A systemic tumor burden model integrating baseline and post-surgery ctDNA is independently prognostic (p = 0.022). Combining systemic tumor burden with pathologic response identifies a highly curable subgroup and a subgroup of high-risk eTNBC patients. ctDNA surveillance during follow-up identifies patients with high relapse risk. In conclusion, systemic ctDNA analysis demonstrates the utility of a systemic tumor burden model of ctDNA in risk stratification of eTNBC patients, which may guide future treatment escalation or de-escalation trials.

10.1186/s12883-025-04132-5	Effects of very early exercise on inflammatory markers and clinical outcomes in	Ademoyegun AB, Awotidebe TO, Odetunde MO, Inaolaji SO, Bakare SO, Azeez FW, Olayemi O	BACKGROUND: Apart from the limited evidence of the effects of very early exercise (VEE) on clinical outcomes (COs) in stroke, better knowledge is required to understand the cellular action induced by VEE. This study investigated the effects of VEE on inflammatory markers (IMs) and COs. It further evaluated the association between acute changes in IMs and COs at follow-up in individuals with first-ever mild-to-moderate ischaemic stroke. METHODS: A prospective, single-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial (retrospectively registered: PACTR202406755848901; 10-06-2024) was conducted. Forty-eight patients randomized (1:1) into the VEE group (VEEG) and usual care group (UCG) completed the follow-up. Within 24 h of stroke onset, patients in VEEG underwent 45 min of VEE twice daily, amounting to 1.5 h/d, for seven days while patients in UCG received regular turning and positioning. The levels of IMs including interleukin-6 (IL-6), fibrinogen, leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes were assessed at baseline, 4th, and 7th day for both groups. Thereafter, each patient received 90-min follow-up physiotherapy twice weekly for three months. Motor impairment, physical disability, functional independence, anxiety, depression, and cognition were evaluated at 1st and 3rd month of follow-up. RESULTS: On the 4th and 7th day, patients in VEEG show trends of lower levels of IL-6, leucocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes and higher levels of lymphocytes. However, a non-linear effect of VEE on plasma fibrinogen was observed compared to UC. Furthermore, better improvement in motor impairment, physical disability, functional independence, anxiety, depression, and cognition were observed in VEEG. The positive modulation of IMs by VEE was associated with COs over time, including associations between changes in IL-6 at days 4 and 7 and 3-month functional independence (r(s) = -0.33; p = 0.019; r(s) = -0.33; p = 0.021), and at day 7 and 3-month motor impairment (r(s) = 0.30; p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Initiating moderate-intensity exercise within 24 h appears beneficial in positively modulating IMs, including IL-6, at the acute stage and improving the physical, motor, cognitive, and affective functions at 1-and 3-month follow-up. The association between exercise-induced acute changes in IMs and improved COs over time highlights the potential role of moderate-intensity VEE in enhancing stroke recovery through positive inflammatory modulation.

10.1186/s12933-025-02687-8	Association of triglyceride-glucose index trajectories with the risk of worsening	Lai Y, Lin C, Liu X, Liu Y, Cai H, Zhao N, Gao Y, Yi Z, Huang J, Li M, Xu L	BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose index serves as a dependable biomarker for gauging insulin resistance linked to cardiovascular disease. Our study was designed to investigate how the trajectory of the triglyceride-glucose index relates to the risk of worsening heart failure and overall mortality in patients aged 60 years and older with chronic heart failure and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This study enrolled 466 patients who had ≥ 3 medical exams. The formula for calculating the triglyceride-glucose index was ln (fasting triglycerides [mg/dL] × fasting blood glucose [mg/dL]/2). The trajectory of the triglyceride-glucose index in longitudinal analysis was analyzed via linear mixed models. The relationships between the trajectory of the TyG index and the risk of worsening heart failure and overall mortality were analyzed via competing Cox regression analysis and mixed-effects Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: After the variables adjustment, compared with the first quartile group, the adjusted hazard ratios for worsening heart failure in top quartile group were 2.40 (1.35-3.28) for 10-year follow-up, and 2.09 (1.22-3.58) for overall follow-up duration. The adjusted hazard ratios for overall mortality in top quartile group were 1.99 (1.56-3.14) for 10-year follow-up, and 1.87 (1.22-2.88) for overall follow-up duration. Compared with the low decreasing trajectory, adjusted hazard ratios for worsening heart failure of high decreasing trajectory were 1.37 (1.10-1.71) for the 5-year follow-up, 1.78 (1.10-2.88) for 10-year follow-up, and 1.67 (1.04-2.68) for overall follow-up duration. The adjusted hazard ratios for overall mortality were 2.16 (1.39-3.35) for 10-year follow-up, and 2.23 (1.46-3.40) for overall follow-up duration. CONCLUSION: During follow-up, a higher baseline level of TyG index and a high decreasing trajectory were independently associated with long-term worsening heart failure and an increased risk of overall mortality.

10.1136/gutjnl-2024-334466	Rectal diclofenac versus indomethacin for prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis	Kang X, Xia M, Wang J, Wang X, Luo H, Qin W, Liang Z, Zhao G, Yang L, Sun H, Tao J, Ning B, Zhong L, Zhang R, Ma X, Zhao J, Yue L, Jin H, Kang C, Ren G, Liang S, Wang H, Wang L, Nie Y, Wu K, Fan DM, Pan Y	BACKGROUND: Recent meta-analyses suggested diclofenac may be superior to indomethacin in preventing post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP). The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of 100 mg rectal indomethacin versus diclofenac on PEP incidences. DESIGN: This multicentre, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial was conducted in nine tertiary centres in China. Patients with low and high risk for PEP and native papilla were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive 100 mg diclofenac or 100 mg indomethacin rectally before ERCP. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PEP defined by the Cotton consensus. The intention-to-treat principle was conducted for the analysis. RESULTS: The trial was terminated early for futility after the predetermined first interim analysis. Between June 2023 and May 2024, 1204 patients were randomised into the diclofenac group (n=600) or indomethacin group (n=604). Baseline characteristics were balanced. The primary outcome occurred in 53 patients (8.8%) of 600 patients allocated to the diclofenac group and 37 patients (6.1%) of 604 patients allocated to the indomethacin group (relative risk 1.44; 95% CI 0.96 to 2.16, p=0.074). PEP occurred in 35 (14.2%) of 247 high-risk patients in the diclofenac group and 26 (9.8%) of 266 high-risk patients in the indomethacin group (p=0.124). PEP incidences were also comparable in low-risk patients between the two groups (18/353 (5.1%) vs 11/338 (3.3%), p=0.227). Other ERCP-related complications did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Pre-procedure 100 mg rectal diclofenac was not superior to the same dose of rectal indomethacin regarding preventing PEP. These findings supported current clinical practice guidelines of 100 mg indomethacin or diclofenac for PEP prophylaxis in patients without contraindications.

Here we present a summary of the 2025 RCC guidelines updated with standardised methodology to provide reproducible evidence for the management of RCC. METHODS: For the 2025 update, a literature search was performed covering the period from May 1, 2023 to May 1, 2024 using the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Libraries. The data search focused on meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and retrospective or controlled comparator-arm studies. Evidence was synthesised as outlined for all EAU guidelines. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Clinical practise recommendations were updated in all chapters of the RCC guidelines on the basis of a structured literature search. The studies included were predominantly retrospective with matched or unmatched cohorts based on single- or multi-institutional data. Several prospective studies and RCTs provided data that resulted in recommendations based on higher levels of evidence. Specifically, updates include new recommendations on stereotactic body radiotherapy for localised RCC, adjuvant therapy, systemic therapy for clear-cell RCC in later lines, other subtypes, and a new chapter on hereditary RCC. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The 2025 RCC guidelines have been updated by a multidisciplinary panel of experts using methodological standards to provide a contemporary evidence base for the management of RCC.

Guo JL, Griffin M, Yoon JK, Lopez DM, Zhu Y, Lu JM, Mikos G, Parker JBL, Mascharak S, Brenac C, Guardino NJ, Abbas DB, Li DJ, Valencia C, Liang NE, Januszyk M, Chang HY, Wan DC, Desai TJ, Longaker MT	Fibrosis, the replacement of healthy tissue with collagen-rich matrix, can occur following injury in almost every organ(1,2). Mouse lungs follow a stereotyped sequence of fibrogenesis-to-resolution after bleomycin injury(3), and we reasoned that profiling post-injury histological stages could uncover pro-fibrotic versus anti-fibrotic features with functional value for human fibrosis. Here we quantified spatiotemporally resolved matrix transformations for integration with multi-omic data. First, we charted stepwise trajectories of matrix aberration versus resolution, derived from a high-dimensional set of histological fibre features, that denoted a reversible transition in uniform-to-disordered histological architecture. Single-cell sequencing along these trajectories identified temporally enriched &#x27;ECM-secreting&#x27; (Csmd1-expressing) and &#x27;pro-resolving&#x27; (Cd248-expressing) fibroblasts at the respective post-injury stages. Visium-based spatial analysis further suggested divergent matrix architectures and spatial-transcriptional neighbourhoods by fibroblast subtype, identifying distinct fibrotic versus non-fibrotic biomolecular milieu. Critically, pro-resolving fibroblast instillation helped to ameliorate fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, the fibroblast neighbourhood-associated factors SERPINE2 and PI16 functionally modulated human lung fibrosis ex vivo. Spatial phenotyping of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at protein level additionally uncovered analogous fibroblast subtypes and neighbourhoods in human disease. Collectively, these findings establish an atlas of pro- and anti-fibrotic factors that underlie lung matrix architecture and implicate fibroblast-associated biological features in modulating fibrotic progression versus resolution.

METHODS: 26 patients were recruited at the Antwerp University Hospital. Eligible patients filled in the MQoL on different moments in time in order to evaluate clinimetric properties. To determine the validity; MQoL was correlated to the EORTC QLQ-C30. Internal consistency was analysed using Cronbach&#x27;s and test-retest reliability was determined by ICC. For statistical responsiveness, S.E.M and MDC were calculated. RESULTS: A strong correlation was found between the &#x27;QoL score&#x27; of the MQoL and the domain &#x27;existential well- being&#x27; of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (r = 0.72). An excellent test-retest reliability (ICC (1,1)) was demonstrated with intraclass coefficients ranging from 0.82 to 0.92. A MDC in total score of only 1.22 (12%) was seen, needed to detect a factual change within a patients&#x27; QoL. Psychometric properties of the Dutch MQoL were found comparable to the properties of the original questionnaire. CONCLUSION: The Dutch version of the MQoL is a valid and reliable questionnaire for breast cancer patients and shows statistical responsiveness. Due to the strong to excellent reliability, this version of the MQoL is useful in clinical as well as scientific setting. 	Facts, views &amp; vision in ObGyn	01/12/2016

This study aimed to clarify the mechanisms connecting the LD aging and herniation, particularly focusing on cellular senescence and molecular alterations in the nucleus pulposus (NP). We performed a detailed analysis of NP samples from a diverse cohort, including individuals of varying ages and those with diagnosed LD herniation. Our methodology combined histological assessments with single-nucleus RNA sequencing to identify phenotypic and molecular changes related to NP aging and herniation. We discovered that cellular senescence and a decrease in nucleus pulposus progenitor cells (NPPCs) are central to both processes. Additionally, we found an age-related increase in NFAT1 expression that promotes NPPC senescence and contributes to both aging and herniation of LD. This research offers fresh insights into LD aging and its associated pathologies, potentially guiding the development of new therapeutic strategies to target the root causes of LD herniation and aging.

In legumes, this area overlaps with nitrogen-fixing nodule formation, which raises the possibility that nodulation and barrier formation are connected. Nodules also contain Casparian strips, yet, in this case, their role is unknown. We established mutants with defective barriers in Lotus japonicus. This revealed that effective apoplastic blockage in the endodermis is important for root-to-shoot signals underlying nodulation. Our findings further revealed that in nodules, the genetic machinery for Casparian strip formation is shared with roots. Apoplastic blockage controls the metabolic source-sink status required for nitrogen fixation. This identifies Casparian strips as a model system to study spatially constrained symbiotic plant-microbe relationships. 	Science (New York, N.Y.)	21/03/2025

Ameku T, Laddach A, Beckwith H, Milona A, Rogers LS, Schwayer C, Nye E, Tough IR, Thoumas JL, Gautam UK, Wang YF, Jha S, Castano-Medina A, Amourda C, Vaelli PM, Gevers S, Irvine EE, Meyer L, Andrew I, Choi KL, Patel B, Francis AJ, Studd C, Game L, Young G, Murphy KG, Owen B, Withers DJ, Rodriguez-Colman M, Cox HM, Liberali P, Schwarzer M, Leulier F, Pachnis V, Bellono NW, Miguel-Aliaga I	The organs of many female animals are remodeled by reproduction. Using the mouse intestine, a striking and tractable model of organ resizing, we find that reproductive remodeling is anticipatory and distinct from diet- or microbiota-induced resizing. Reproductive remodeling involves partially irreversible elongation of the small intestine and fully reversible growth of its epithelial villi, associated with an expansion of isthmus progenitors and accelerated enterocyte migration. We identify induction of the SGLT3a transporter in a subset of enterocytes as an early reproductive hallmark. Electrophysiological and genetic interrogations indicate that SGLT3a does not sustain digestive functions or enterocyte health; rather, it detects protons and sodium to extrinsically support the expansion of adjacent Fgfbp1-positive isthmus progenitors, promoting villus growth. Our findings reveal unanticipated specificity to physiological organ remodeling. We suggest that organ- and state-specific growth programs could be leveraged to improve pregnancy outcomes or prevent maladaptive consequences of such growth. 	Cell	14/03/2025
10.1016/j.annonc.2025.03.007	The impact of the immunological context on outcomes of solid cancer patients	Mubarak O, Middleton G	INTRODUCTION: Outcomes with genotype-matched targeted therapy in solid cancer patients are heterogeneous: some have exceptional responses, others primary progression. This review explores the immunobiological features which may underlie this differential response. METHODS: We conducted a literature review of studies assessing impact of immune context following searches on Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Relevant outcomes include response, progression-free survival and overall survival. Data was extracted from multivariate analysis, univariate analysis or directly from Kaplan-Meier curves. Meta-analyses were performed where three or more studies analysed the same immune factor for the same cancer type. Remaining studies were analysed descriptively. RESULTS: In the adjuvant setting assessment of the immune context does not highlight a group failing to derive benefit for the use of dabrafenib/trametinib after resection of BRAFV600E melanoma Differential gene expression in exceptional responders show enrichment of genes associated with immune activation. BRAFV600E colorectal cancer patients with high cytolytic scores benefit from the addition of MEK inhibition whereas those with low scores fare better without. High PD-L1 expression is predictive of inferior outcomes to EGFR, ALK and G12C tyrosine kinase inhibitors. EGFR-mutant patients with high CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 positivity have very poor outcomes. Stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes predicts for efficacy of stromal-poor tumours in HER-2+ breast cancer treated with short-course adjuvant trastuzumab. High immune metagene and single immune gene expression is predictive of benefit for chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, but not chemotherapy alone. The addition of pertuzumab or lapatanib appears to be beneficial in those with immune non-enriched microenvironments. High MHCI is negatively and high MHCII positively predictive of outcome with trastuzumab-based therapy. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first review assessing immunological context as biomarker for targeted therapy. The results of this review represent an important resource to aid future translational studies in advancing stratified precision medicine oncology.

10.1038/s41392-025-02191-1	Intranasal prime-boost RNA vaccination elicits potent T cell response for lung	Li H, Hu Y, Li J, He J, Yu G, Wang J, Lin X	The rapid success of RNA vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 has sparked interest in their use for cancer immunotherapy. Although many cancers originate in mucosal tissues, current RNA cancer vaccines are mainly administered non-mucosally. Here, we developed a non-invasive intranasal cancer vaccine utilizing circular RNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles to induce localized mucosal immune responses. This strategy elicited potent anti-tumor T cell responses in preclinical lung cancer models while mitigating the systemic adverse effects commonly associated with intravenous RNA vaccination. Specifically, type 1 conventional dendritic cells were indispensable for T cell priming post-vaccination, with both alveolar macrophages and type 1 conventional dendritic cells boosting antigen-specific T cell responses in lung tissues. Moreover, the vaccination facilitated the expansion of both endogenous and adoptive transferred antigen-specific T cells, resulting in robust anti-tumor efficacy. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the vaccination reprograms endogenous T cells, enhancing their cytotoxicity and inducing a memory-like phenotype. Additionally, the intranasal vaccine can modulate the response of CAR-T cells to augment therapeutic efficacy against tumor cells expressing specific tumor-associated antigens. Collectively, the intranasal RNA vaccine strategy represents a novel and promising approach for developing RNA vaccines targeting mucosal malignancies.

10.1186/s12967-024-05972-4	Association between adjustable dietary factors and periodontitis: NHANES	Chen L, Zhao R, Zhang Y	BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is the major cause of tooth loss in adults and one of the most common non-communicable diseases. Clinically, periodontitis impairs oral health and associated with various systemic diseases. Maintaining a healthy diet is considered risk reduction of periodontitis. To explore the causal effect between dietary data and periodontitis by Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. METHODS: A total of 11,704 participants and 21 dietary variables from the NHANES were in random forest to rank the importance in predicting periodontitis. Data were from the genome wide association studies (GWASs) database to estimate causal relationships between diet data and periodontitis. Two-sample MR analyses were conducted by using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method. RESULTS: The MR showed alcohol consumption and sugars intake increased the risk of chronic periodontitis with odds ratio (OR) 2.768 (95% CI: 1.03e + 00-7.42e + 00) and 2.123 (95% CI: 1.06e + 00-4.26e + 00) respectively. Vitamins and minerals, including folic acid and folate, magnesium, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, calcium, vitamin D and zinc, were not causally associated with chronic periodontitis. Alcohol consumption greater than 2.5 drinks per day and sugar intake more than 4.88 g increased the risk of periodontitis, with a calculated relative risk of 1.33 and 1.61, respectively. CONCLUSION: It is suggested to drink alcohol less than 2.5 drinks/day and consume sugar less than 4.88 g/day to avoid alcohol and sugar consumption promoting the development of periodontitis. Establishing a dietary pattern conducive to periodontal health may be the focus of further clinical research. 	Journal of translational medicine	20/03/2025
10.1210/clinem/dgaf191	Testosterone and Male Bone Health: A Puzzle of Interactions.	Tenuta M, Hasenmajer V, Gianfrilli D, Isidori AM	Sex steroids are pivotal in skeletal development and maintenance throughout life. Testosterone primarily drives male cortical bone growth and periosteal expansion, particularly during puberty, while estradiol is essential for trabecular bone formation and inhibiting resorption. The conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and estradiol, the transport proteins, the somatotropic axis, and the non-androgenic functions of the testis underscore the intricate interplay protecting male bone health. Clinical models, including estrogen resistance, aromatase deficiency, and complete androgen insensitivity syndromes, highlight estradiol&#x27;s critical role in maintaining male bone integrity. The use of aromatase inhibitors and androgen deprivation therapy reveals the adverse effects of estrogen and androgen blockade, often resulting in significant bone loss. Gender-affirming hormone therapies provide further insights into testosterone&#x27;s influence on cortical bone during development and the maintenance role of sex steroids in adulthood. This review digs into the link between male hypogonadism and osteoporosis, emphasizing testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and findings from major trials, including T-Trial Bone, T4Bone, and TRAVERSE Fracture. While TRT has been shown to improve bone mineral density (BMD), its effect on fracture risk remains inconclusive. Unexpected findings from the TRAVERSE Fracture trial highlight the importance of caution and confirm that anti-resorptive therapies remain the first-line treatment for male osteoporosis. Investigating the synergistic effects of combining TRT with anti-resorptive therapies, the impact of therapeutic timing on peak bone mass accrual, and the role of confounders in fracture risk are promising areas for future research to optimize male skeletal health.

10.1126/sciadv.adt2117	CD38-mediated metabolic reprogramming promotes the stability and suppressive	Sarkar I, Basak D, Ghosh P, Gautam A, Bhoumik A, Singh P, Kar A, Mahanti S, Chowdhury S, Chakraborty L, Mondal S, Mukherjee R, Mehrotra S, Majumder S, Sengupta S, Paul S, Chatterjee S	In the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulatory T cells (T(regs)) adapt their metabolism to thrive in low-glucose, high-lactate conditions, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Our study identifies CD38 as a key regulator of this adaptation by depleting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD(+)), redirecting lactate-derived pyruvate toward phosphoenolpyruvate and bypassing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. This prevents accumulation of α-ketoglutarate, which destabilizes T(regs) by inducing hypermethylation at the Foxp3 locus. Restoring NAD(+) with nicotinamide mononucleotide reverses this adaptation, pushing T(regs) back to the TCA cycle and reducing their suppressive function. In YUMM1.7 melanoma-bearing mice, small-molecule CD38 inhibition selectively destabilizes intratumoral T(regs), sparking robust antitumor immunity. These findings reveal that targeting the CD38-NAD(+) axis disrupts T(regs) metabolic adaptation and offers a strategy to enhance antitumor responses. 	Science advances	21/03/2025
10.1038/s41422-025-01095-7	Molecular mechanism of the arrestin-biased agonism of neurotensin receptor 1 by	Sun D, Li X, Yuan Q, Wang Y, Shi P, Zhang H, Wang T, Sun W, Ling S, Liu Y, Lai J, Xie W, Yin W, Liu L, Xu HE, Tian C	Biased allosteric modulators (BAMs) of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been at the forefront of drug discovery owing to their potential to selectively stimulate therapeutically relevant signaling and avoid on-target side effects. Although structures of GPCRs in complex with G protein or GRK in a BAM-bound state have recently been resolved, revealing that BAM can induce biased signaling by directly modulating interactions between GPCRs and these two transducers, no BAM-bound GPCR-arrestin complex structure has yet been determined, limiting our understanding of the full pharmacological profile of BAMs. Herein, we developed a chemical protein synthesis strategy to generate neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) with defined hexa-phosphorylation at its C-terminus and resolved high-resolution cryo-EM structures (2.65-2.88 Å) of NTSR1 in complex with both β-arrestin1 and the BAM SBI-553. These structures revealed a unique &quot;loop engagement&quot; configuration of β-arrestin1 coupling to NTSR1 in the presence of SBI-553, markedly different from the typical &quot;core engagement&quot; configuration observed in the absence of BAMs. This configuration is characterized by the engagement of the intracellular loop 3 of NTSR1 with a cavity in the central crest of β-arrestin1, representing a previously unobserved, arrestin-selective conformation of GPCR. Our findings fill the critical knowledge gap regarding the regulation of GPCR-arrestin interactions and biased signaling by BAMs, which would advance the development of safer and more efficacious GPCR-targeted therapeutics.

10.1038/s41467-025-58107-8	Microbiota-indole-3-propionic acid-heart axis mediates the protection of	Huang R, Shen ZY, Huang D, Zhao SH, Dan LX, Wu P, Tang QZ, Ma ZG	Anti-programmed death 1 (αPD1) immune checkpoint blockade is used in combination for cancer treatment but associated with cardiovascular toxicity. Leflunomide (Lef) can suppress the growth of several tumor and mitigate cardiac remodeling in mice. However, the role of Lef in αPD1-induced cardiotoxicity remains unclear. Here, we report that Lef treatment inhibits αPD1-related cardiotoxicity without compromising the efficacy of αPD1-mediated immunotherapy. Lef changes community structure of gut microbiota in αPD1-treated melanoma-bearing mice. Moreover, mice receiving microbiota transplants from Lef+αPD1-treated melanoma-bearing mice have better cardiac function compared to mice receiving transplants from αPD1-treated mice. Mechanistically, we analyze metabolomics and identify indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), which protects cardiac dysfunction in αPD1-treated mice. IPA can directly bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and promote phosphoinositide 3-kinase expression, thus curtailing the cardiomyocyte response to immune injury. Our findings reveal that Lef mitigates αPD1-induced cardiac toxicity in melanoma-bearing mice through modulation of the microbiota-IPA-heart axis. 	Nature communications	19/03/2025
10.1126/sciadv.ads5458	SIP2 is the master transcription factor of Plasmodium merozoite formation.	Nishi T, Kaneko I, Yuda M	Malaria, one of the most serious infectious diseases worldwide, is caused by the proliferation of Plasmodium parasites through repeated cycles of intraerythrocytic development. The parasite replicates via schizogony in host erythrocytes, producing multiple progeny merozoites that invade new erythrocytes. Although merozoite formation is the most crucial step in malaria pathogenesis, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. SIP2 is an AP2 transcription factor expressed during schizogony and is particularly conserved among erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites. Here, we reveal that SIP2 in Plasmodium berghei (PbSIP2) functions as the master transcription factor for merozoite formation. Conditional disruption of pbsip2 resulted in developmental arrest before merozoite formation and notable down-regulation of merozoite-related genes. ChIP-seq showed that PbSIP2 comprehensively activated merozoite-related genes by binding to previously reported cis-regulatory elements of merozoite invasion-related genes, including the bipartite motif (TGCAN(4-6)GTGCA). Collectively, our results indicate that SIP2 is a transcription factor that establishes erythrocyte infectivity and may have an evolutionary origin from the common ancestor of erythrocyte-infecting apicomplexan parasites.

10.1007/s11883-025-01290-2	Managing Dyslipidemia in Chronic Kidney Disease: Implications for Cardiovascular	Theofilis P, Vlachakis PK, Karakasis P, Kalaitzidis RG	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The review aims to address the complex relationship between dyslipidemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD), emphasizing its dual role in driving cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and contributing to CKD progression. It explores pathophysiological mechanisms, highlights recent biomarker discoveries, and evaluates contemporary and emerging lipid-lowering therapies tailored for CKD patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have highlighted the inadequacy of traditional lipid markers like LDL-C in reflecting cardiovascular risk in CKD. Novel biomarkers, such as remnant cholesterol and lipoprotein(a), demonstrate stronger associations with adverse outcomes. Emerging lipid-lowering agents, including bempedoic acid, pemafibrate, and PCSK9 inhibitors, show promise for risk reduction, especially in non-dialysis-dependent CKD. However, evidence remains limited for advanced stages of CKD and dialysis patients. Furthermore, alterations in lipid metabolism, such as dysfunctional HDL and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, are now recognized as significant contributors to CVD and renal damage in CKD populations. Dyslipidemia is a pivotal modifiable risk factor in CKD, exacerbating both cardiovascular risk and disease progression. While statins remain the cornerstone of therapy in early-to-moderate CKD, their efficacy diminishes in advanced stages. The advent of novel therapeutic options and a deeper understanding of dyslipidemia&#x27;s pathophysiology hold potential for improving outcomes. Future research should prioritize personalized approaches, focusing on the unique metabolic derangements of CKD and advancing treatments for high-risk and dialysis-dependent patients.

10.1111/jcmm.70434	Machine Learning-Based Glycolipid Metabolism Gene Signature Predicts Prognosis	Zhu L, Liang F, Han X, Ye B, Xue L	Using machine learning approaches, we developed and validated a novel prognostic model for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) based on glycolipid metabolism-related genes. Through integrated analysis of TCGA and GEO datasets, we established a robust 15-gene signature that effectively stratified patients into distinct risk groups. This signature demonstrated superior prognostic value and revealed significant associations with immune infiltration patterns. High-risk patients exhibited reduced immune cell infiltration, particularly in B cells and NK cells, alongside increased tumour purity. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis uncovered unique cellular composition patterns and enhanced interaction intensities in the high-risk group, especially within epithelial and smooth muscle cells. Functional validation confirmed MECP2 as a promising therapeutic target, with its knockdown significantly inhibiting tumour progression both in vitro and in vivo. Drug sensitivity analysis identified specific therapeutic agents showing potential efficacy for high-risk patients. Our study provides both a practical prognostic tool and novel insights into the relationship between glycolipid metabolism and tumour immunity in ESCC, offering potential strategies for personalised treatment.

10.1038/s41591-025-03570-5	Optimal dietary patterns for healthy aging.	Tessier AJ, Wang F, Korat AA, Eliassen AH, Chavarro J, Grodstein F, Li J, Liang L, Willett WC, Sun Q, Stampfer MJ, Hu FB, Guasch-Ferré M	As the global population ages, it is critical to identify diets that, beyond preventing noncommunicable diseases, optimally promote healthy aging. Here, using longitudinal questionnaire data from the Nurses&#x27; Health Study (1986-2016) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986-2016), we examined the association of long-term adherence to eight dietary patterns and ultraprocessed food consumption with healthy aging, as assessed according to measures of cognitive, physical and mental health, as well as living to 70 years of age free of chronic diseases. After up to 30 years of follow-up, 9,771 (9.3%) of 105,015 participants (66% women, mean age = 53 years (s.d. = 8)) achieved healthy aging. For each dietary pattern, higher adherence was associated with greater odds of healthy aging and its domains. The odds ratios for the highest quintile versus the lowest ranged from 1.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-1.57; healthful plant-based diet) to 1.86 (95% CI = 1.71-2.01; Alternative Healthy Eating Index). When the age threshold for healthy aging was shifted to 75 years, the Alternative Healthy Eating Index diet showed the strongest association with healthy aging, with an odds ratio of 2.24 (95% CI = 2.01-2.50). Higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unsaturated fats, nuts, legumes and low-fat dairy products were linked to greater odds of healthy aging, whereas higher intakes of trans fats, sodium, sugary beverages and red or processed meats (or both) were inversely associated. Our findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal-based foods, may enhance overall healthy aging, guiding future dietary guidelines.

Here we show that neurons in the medial vestibular nuclei parvocellular part (MVePC) mediate the hypothermic responses induced by motion. Reactivation of motion-sensitive MVePC neurons recapitulates motion sickness in mice. We show that motion-activated neurons in the MVePC are glutamatergic (MVePC(Glu)), and that optogenetic stimulation of MVePC(Glu) neurons mimics motion-induced hypothermia by signalling to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). Acute inhibition of MVePC-LPBN circuitry abrogates motion-induced hypothermia. Finally, we show that chronic inhibition of MVePC(Glu) neurons prevents diet-induced obesity and improves glucose homeostasis without suppressing food intake. Overall, these findings highlight MVePC(Glu) neurons as a potential target for motion-sickness treatment and obesity control. 	Nature metabolism	21/03/2025

Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), favored by diabetes and obesity, was shown to contribute to HFpEF pathophysiology and is an emerging therapeutic target. This study explored the relationship between ventricular EAT measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), metabolic factors, and imaging characteristics in controls, pre-HF patients, and HFpEF patients. METHODS: Patients from a Belgian cohort enrolled from December 2015 to June 2017 were categorized by HF stage: pre-HF (n = 16), HFpEF (n = 104) and compared to matched controls (n = 26) and to pre-HF (n = 191) from the Beta3-LVH cohort. Biventricular EAT volume was measured in end-diastolic short-axis cine stacks. In the Belgian cohort, associations between EAT, HF stage, and various biological and imaging markers were explored. The clinical endpoint was a composite of mortality or first HF hospitalization in the HFpEF group. RESULTS: EAT significantly differed between groups, with higher values in HFpEF patients compared to pre-HF and controls (72.4 ± 20.8ml/m(2)vs. 55.0 ± 11.8ml/m(2) and 48 ± 8.9ml/m(2), p &lt; 0.001) from the Belgian cohort and to pre-HF (52.0 ± 15.0 ml/m(2), p &lt; 0.001) from the Beta3-LVH cohort. Subsequent analyses focused on the Belgian cohort. In contrast to atrial fibrillation, diabetes prevalence and body mass index (BMI) did not differ between pre-HF and HFpEF patients. Multivariable logistic regression and random forest classification identified EAT, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and H(2)FPEF score as strong markers of HFpEF status. EAT was significantly correlated with H(2)FPEF score (r = 0.41, p = 0.003), BMI (r = 0.30, p &lt; 0.001), high-sensitive troponin T (r = 0.41, p &lt; 0.001), NT-proBNP (r = 0.37, p &lt; 0.001), soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 (sST2) (r = 0.30, p &lt; 0.001), E/e&#x27; ratio (r = 0.33, p &lt; 0.001), and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (r = 0.35, p &lt; 0.001). In HFpEF patients, diabetes, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and elevated sST2 were independently associated with elevated EAT. In contrast with diabetes and BMI, increased EAT was not associated with prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: EAT assessed by CMR was significantly higher in HFpEF patients compared to controls and pre-HF patients, irrespective of diabetes and BMI. EAT was moderately associated with HFpEF status. HFpEF patients with elevated EAT exhibited a marked diabetic, ischemic, and inflammatory profile, highlighting the potential role of drugs targeting EAT.

Smoking significantly increases AMD risk, yet the mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of Sema4D-PlexinB1 axis in the progression of AMD, in which Sema4D-PlexinB1 is highly activated by smoking. Using patient-derived samples and mouse models, we discover that smoking increases the presence of Sema4D on the surface of CD8(+) T cells that migrate into the choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesion via CXCL12-CXCR4 axis and interact with its receptor PlexinB1 on choroidal pericytes. This leads to ROR2-mediated PlexinB1 phosphorylation and pericyte activation, thereby disrupting vascular homeostasis and promoting neovascularization. Inhibition of Sema4D reduces CNV and improves the benefit of anti-VEGF treatment. In conclusion, this study unveils the molecular mechanisms through which smoking exacerbates AMD pathology, and presents a potential therapeutic strategy by targeting Sema4D to augment current AMD treatments.

10.1038/s41419-025-07498-z	Histone lactylation enhances GCLC expression and thus promotes chemoresistance of	Deng J, Li Y, Yin L, Liu S, Li Y, Liao W, Mu L, Luo X, Qin J	Colorectal cancer stem cells (CCSCs) play a critical role in mediating chemoresistance. Lactylation is a post-translational modification induced by lactate that regulates gene expression. However, whether lactylation affects the chemoresistance of CCSCs remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that histone lactylation enhances CCSC chemoresistance both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our findings showed that p300 catalyzes the lactylation of histone H4 at K12, whereas HDAC1 facilitates its delactylation in CCSCs. Notably, lactylation at H4K12 (H4K12la) upregulates GCLC expression and inhibits ferroptosis in CCSCs, and the inhibition of p300 or LDHA decreases H4K12la levels, thereby increasing the chemosensitivity of CCSCs. Additionally, the GCLC inhibitor BSO promotes ferroptosis and sensitizes CCSCs to oxaliplatin. Taken together, these findings suggest that histone lactylation upregulates GCLC to inhibit ferroptosis signaling, thus enhancing CCSC chemoresistance. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between cellular metabolism and chemoresistance and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting p300, LDHA, and GCLC. We showed that histones H4K12 lactylation promoted chemoresistance in CSCs. p300 catalyzes the lactylation of histone H4 at K12, HDAC1 inhibits the histone lactylation at the same site. H4K12la in CSCs regulates the expression of the ferroptosis-related gene GCLC, thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and leading to chemoresistance. Targeting the p300, LDHA, or GCLC may be overcome tumor chemoresistance. 	Cell death &amp; disease	20/03/2025

The mechanisms underlying this effect remain elusive. Here, in vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening identifies SFRP2 as a potential stromal regulator of the abscopal effect. SFRP2 exhibits cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-specific expression and radioimmunotherapy-mediated upregulation in unirradiated tumors. Conditional Sfrp2 knockout in CAFs boosts the abscopal effect by rewiring the vascular-immune microenvironment to promote CD8(+) T cell recruitment to unirradiated tumors. In vivo lineage tracing reveals that elevated SFRP2 correlates with radioimmunotherapy-driven pericyte lineage commitment. Serum proteomics reveals that irradiated-tumor-secreted PAI-1 triggers distant tumor pericyte cell-fate transition into SFRP2(high) CAFs via the LRP1/p65 axis. Pharmacologically blocking SFRP2 or PAI-1 enhances the abscopal effect in humanized patient-derived xenograft models. Our findings collectively illustrate that PAI-1-induced SFRP2(high) CAFs serve as critical stromal regulator to hijack the abscopal effect, providing promising targets for enhancing radioimmunotherapy effectiveness.

10.1016/j.jprot.2021.104190	Chronic restraint stress induced changes in colonic homeostasis-related indexes	Li CC, Gan L, Tan Y, Yan MZ, Liu XM, Chang Q, Pan RL	Chronic stressors represented risk factors for the etiology or exacerbation of several gastrointestinal diseases. The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic restraint stress (CRS) could initiate and aggravate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and metabolic disturbance of rats. Firstly, increased inflammatory cytokines (interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and interleukin-10(IL-10)) and decreased tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin and zonula occludins-1 (ZO-1)) in rat colon were observed. Secondly, untargeted metabolomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) revealed that TRP metabolism was the most prominently affected. Thirdly, quantification of TRP and its metabolites via prominence ultrafast liquid chromatography coupled with a QTRAP 5500 mass (UFLC-QTRAP-5500/MS) showed that TRP, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KA) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) were significantly increased. At the same time, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was unchanged and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) was significantly decreased in the colon of CRS rats. Besides, TRP metabolic enzyme changes were with the same trends as the corresponding metabolites. Thus, our data showed that CRS could initiate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and colonic metabolism disturbance, especially TRP-KYN metabolism pathway of rats, which may provide an experimental background for future research on stress-related gastrointestinal dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic exposure to psychological stress could induce metabolic imbalance of the body, and stressful life events were intimately correlated with frequent relapses in patients with intestinal disorders. The present study showed that chronic restraint stress (CRS) could initiate and aggravate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and metabolic disturbance, especially tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism of rats. Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway may be involved in the initiation and development of diseases induced by chronic stress. This research may shed light on future research on stress-related gastrointestinal dysfunction. 	Journal of proteomics	30/05/2021

However, the role of the gut phageome under dietary influences is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the effect of diet on the gut phageome-bacteriome interaction linking to CD protection. DESIGN: We recruited CD patients and healthy subjects (n=140) and conducted a multiomics investigation, including paired ileal mucosa phageome and bacteriome profiling, dietary survey and phenome interrogation. We screened for the effect of diet on the gut phageome and bacteriome, as well as its epidemiological association with CD risks. The underlying mechanisms were explored in target phage-bacteria monocultures and cocultures in vitro and in two mouse models in vivo. RESULTS: On dietary screening in humans, whey protein (WP) consumption was found to profoundly impact the gut phageome and bacteriome (more pronounced on the phageome) and was associated with a lower CD risk. Indeed, the WP reshaped gut phageome can causally attenuate intestinal inflammation, as shown by faecal phageome versus bacteriome transplantation from WP-consuming versus WP-non-consuming mice to recipient mice. Mechanistically, WP induced phage (a newly isolated phage AkkZT003P herein) lysis of the mucin-foraging bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila, which unleashed the symbiotic bacterium Streptococcus thermophilus to counteract intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSION: Our study charted the importance of cross-kingdom interaction between gut phage and bacteria in mediating the dietary effect on CD protection. Importantly, we uncovered a beneficial dietary WP, a keystone phage AkkZT003P, and a probiotic S. thermophilus that can be used in CD management in the future. 	Gut	23/03/2025
10.1056/NEJMoa2414482	Tezepelumab in Adults with Severe Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyps.	Lipworth BJ, Han JK, Desrosiers M, Hopkins C, Lee SE, Mullol J, Pfaar O, Li T, Chen C, Almqvist G, Margolis MK, McLaren J, Jagadeesh S, MacKay J, Megally A, Hellqvist Å, Mankad VS, Bahadori L, Ponnarambil SS	BACKGROUND: Treatment with tezepelumab has been effective for sinonasal symptoms in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma and a history of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, but its efficacy and safety in adults with severe, uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is unknown. METHODS: We randomly assigned adults with physician-diagnosed, symptomatic, severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps to receive standard care and either tezepelumab (at a dose of 210 mg) or placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. The coprimary end points were the changes from baseline in the total nasal-polyp score (range, 0 to 4 [for each nostril]; higher scores indicate greater severity) and the mean nasal-congestion score (range, 0 to 3; higher scores indicate greater severity) at week 52. Key secondary end points assessed in the overall population were the loss-of-smell score, the total score on the Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22; range, 0 to 110; higher scores indicate greater severity), the Lund-Mackay score (range, 0 to 24; higher scores indicate greater severity), the total symptom score (range, 0 to 24; higher scores indicate greater severity), and the first decision to treat with nasal-polyp surgery or use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy, or both, assessed in time-to-event analyses (individual and composite). RESULTS: In total, 203 patients were assigned to receive tezepelumab and 205 to receive placebo. At week 52, the patients who received tezepelumab had significant improvements in the total nasal-polyp score (mean difference vs. placebo, -2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.39 to -1.74) and the mean nasal-congestion score (-1.03; 95% CI, -1.20 to -0.86) (P&lt;0.001 for both scores). Tezepelumab significantly improved the loss-of-smell score (mean difference vs. placebo, -1.00; 95% CI, -1.18 to -0.83), SNOT-22 total score (-27.26; 95% CI, -32.32 to -22.21), Lund-Mackay score (-5.72; 95% CI, -6.39 to -5.06), and total symptom score (-6.89; 95% CI, -8.02 to -5.76) (P&lt;0.001 for all scores). Surgery for nasal polyps was indicated in significantly fewer patients in the tezepelumab group (0.5%) than in the placebo group (22.1%) (hazard ratio, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.09); there was significantly less use of systemic glucocorticoids with tezepelumab (5.2%) than with placebo (18.3%) (hazard ratio, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.27) (P&lt;0.001 for both time-to-event analyses). CONCLUSIONS: Tezepelumab therapy led to significantly greater reductions in the size of nasal polyps, the severity of nasal congestion and sinonasal symptoms, and the use of nasal-polyp surgery and systemic glucocorticoids than placebo in adults with severe, uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

Previous research exploring amino acid metabolism in HCC has primarily focused on how metabolic reprogramming impacts tumor cells. Here, we focused on the role of amino acid metabolism dysregulation in the crosstalk between HCC and T cells. HCC cells disrupted lysine uptake in T cells, leading to impaired T cell immunity. Lysine deprivation decreased STAT3 levels in T cells, inhibiting T cell proliferation and effector function and ultimately promoting tumor progression. Mechanistically, HCC cells outcompeted T cells for lysine by expressing high levels of the lysine transporter SLC3A2. Clinically, elevated SLC3A2 expression correlated with poor survival and was linked to dysregulated T cell functional gene signatures in HCC patients. Furthermore, the multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib induced a c-Myc-SLC3A2 regulatory axis that limited the efficacy of lenvatinib treatment. Lysine supplementation enhanced tumor sensitivity to combined treatment with lenvatinib and anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. These findings suggest that lysine supplementation is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating HCC and enhancing the sensitivity of HCC to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade.

10.1186/s12933-025-02625-8	Piezo1 deletion mitigates diabetic cardiomyopathy by maintaining mitochondrial	Niu W, Liu X, Deng B, Hong T, Wang C, Yan Y, Liu J, Jiang Y, Li J	OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence highlights the critical role of Piezo1 in cardiovascular diseases, with its expression upregulated in diabetic heart. However, the involvement of Piezo1 in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the regulatory role of Piezo1 in mitochondrial dynamics within the context of DCM and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: We constructed cardiac-specific knockout of Piezo1 (Piezo1(∆Myh6)) mice. Type 1 diabetes was induced using streptozotocin (STZ) injection while type 2 diabetes was established through a high-fat diet combined with STZ. Echocardiography assessed left ventricular function, histological evaluations used HE and Masson staining to examine cardiac pathology in Piezo1(fl/fl) controls, Piezo1(∆Myh6) controls, Piezo1(fl/fl) diabetic and Piezo1(∆Myh6) diabetic mice. Mitochondrial function including oxygen species level, mitochondrial morphology, and respiration rate were also assessed. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that Piezo1 expression was upregulated in the myocardium of diabetic mice and in high-glucose-treated cells. Cardiac-specific knockout of Piezo1 improved cardiac dysfunction and ameliorated cardiac fibrosis in diabetic mice. Moreover, Piezo1 deficiency also attenuated mitochondrial impairment. Piezo1(fl/fl) diabetic mice exhibited increased calpain activity and excessive mitochondrial fission mediated by Drp1 and obvious reduced fusion; however, Piezo1 deficiency restored calpain levels and mitochondrial dysfunction. These observations were also corroborated in H9C2 cells and neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes. Cardiac-specific knockout of Piezo1 increased phosphorylation of Drp1 and ERK1/2 in vivo and in vitro. Piezo1 knockout or treatment with inhibitor improved mitochondrial function. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence that Piezo1 is elevated in DCM through the modulation of mitochondrial dynamics, which is reversed by Piezo1 deficiency. Thus, Piezo1 inhibition may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of DCM. 	Cardiovascular diabetology	20/03/2025
10.1053/j.gastro.2025.02.036	Perforin Generated by CD8(+) T Cells Exacerbates IBD-Induced Depression by	Huang S, Pan L, Pang S, Guo H, Li M, Tian Y, Shi W, Liu B, Wang S, Fan Z, Zong Y, Tian D, Zhang D	BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Approximately 25.2% of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients suffer from psychological disorders, particularly depression. Recent studies have indicated a close relationship between intestinal immunity and brain disorders. METHODS: We performed transcriptome analysis and immunofluorescence staining of colonic samples from IBD patients. The role of perforin generated by colonic CD8(+) T cells in IBD-induced depression was investigated in DSS- and CD8(+) T-cell transfer-induced colitis by using Prf1-EGFP reporter and Prf1 knockout mice. RESULTS: In this study, we revealed a significant correlation between depressive symptom severity and perforin production in CD8(+) T cells in both IBD patients and mice with colitis. Moreover, perforin deficiency in CD8(+) T cells mitigated both inflammation and depressive-like behaviors in mice with colitis. Mechanistically, perforin and granzyme B were found to stimulate the expression of CXCL9 in colonic epithelial cells. CXCL9 was shown to be released into the circulation and to enter the hippocampus, where it induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in hippocampal neurons through the CXCR3-HSPA5 axis. This cascade of events subsequently was found to exacerbate depression. Neutralizing CXCL9 in vivo alleviated depression but had no effect on colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Perforin generated by colonic CD8(+) T cells promotes intestinal epithelial cell CXCL9 production, which leads to neuronal ER stress in hippocampus and induces depression in IBD.

10.1038/s41596-025-01145-9	Spatially resolved genome-wide joint profiling of epigenome and transcriptome	Li H, Bao S, Farzad N, Qin X, Fung AA, Zhang D, Bai Z, Tao B, Fan R	The epigenome of a cell is tightly correlated with gene transcription, which controls cell identity and diverse biological activities. Recent advances in spatial technologies have improved our understanding of tissue heterogeneity by analyzing transcriptomics or epigenomics with spatial information preserved, but have been mainly restricted to one molecular layer at a time. Here we present procedures for two spatially resolved sequencing methods, spatial-ATAC-RNA-seq and spatial-CUT&amp;Tag-RNA-seq, that co-profile transcriptome and epigenome genome wide. In both methods, transcriptomic readouts are generated through tissue fixation, permeabilization and in situ reverse transcription. In spatial-ATAC-RNA-seq, Tn5 transposase is used to probe accessible chromatin, and in spatial-CUT&amp;Tag-RNA-seq, the tissue is incubated with primary antibodies that target histone modifications, followed by Protein A-fused Tn5-induced tagmentation. Both methods leverage a microfluidic device that delivers two sets of oligonucleotide barcodes to generate a two-dimensional mosaic of tissue pixels at near single-cell resolution. A spatial-ATAC-RNA-seq or spatial-CUT&amp;Tag-RNA-seq library can be generated in 3-5 d, allowing researchers to simultaneously investigate the transcriptomic landscape and epigenomic landscape of an intact tissue section. This protocol is an extension of our previous spatially resolved epigenome sequencing protocol and provides opportunities in multimodal profiling. 	Nature protocols	21/03/2025
10.1126/science.adt7570	Hippocampal encoding of memories in human infants.	Yates TS, Fel J, Choi D, Trach JE, Behm L, Ellis CT, Turk-Browne NB	Humans lack memories for specific events from the first few years of life. We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy. The availability of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during a period of human life that is later lost from our autobiographical record implies that postencoding mechanisms, whereby memories from infancy become inaccessible for retrieval, may be more responsible for infantile amnesia.

Here, we report an underappreciated role for γδ IELs in maintaining immunological tolerance during the onset and progression of CD-like ileitis using TNF(ΔARE/+) mice. We found that TNF-induced down-regulation of epithelial hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-gamma/butyrophilin is followed by a loss of ileal Vγ7 IELs and impaired barrier surveillance before the histological onset of disease. A reduction of immunoregulatory CD39(+) γδ IELs coincided with the influx of immature, peripheral CD39(neg) γδ T cells into the epithelium, leading to an expansion of induced IELs, whereas an earlier depletion of γδ IELs correlated with accelerated onset of ileal inflammation. Our findings identify multiple layers of γδ IEL dysregulation before ileitis development, indicating that the loss of steady-state immunoregulatory γδ IELs may contribute to the initiation of ileal CD.

Here we identify mutations in TET2 as the most common co-occurring mutation in TP53 mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In mice, combined hematopoietic-specific deletion of TET2 and TP53 resulted in enhanced self-renewal compared to deletion of either gene alone. Tp53/Tet2 double knockout mice developed serially transplantable AML. Both mice and AML patients with combined TET2/TP53 alterations upregulated innate immune signaling in malignant granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs), which had leukemia-initiating capacity. A20 governs the leukemic maintenance by triggering aberrant non-canonical NF-κB signaling. Mice with Tp53/Tet2 loss had expansion of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which impaired T cell proliferation and activation. Moreover, mice and AML patients with combined TP53/TET2 alterations displayed increased expression of the TIGIT ligand, CD155, on malignant cells. TIGIT blocking antibodies augmented NK cell-mediated killing of Tp53/Tet2 double-mutant AML cells, reduced leukemic burden, and prolonged survival in Tp53/Tet2 double knockout mice. These findings uncover a leukemia-promoting link between TET2 and TP53 mutations and highlight therapeutic strategies to overcome the immunosuppressive bone marrow environment in this adverse subtype of AML.

10.1186/s12933-025-02684-x	Impact of glycemic control metrics on short- and long-term mortality in	Yu Q, Fu Q, Ma X, Wang H, Xia Y, Chen Y, Li P, Li Y, Wu Y	BACKGROUND: Glycemic control is critical for managing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) patients, especially those in intensive care units (ICUs). Emerging metrics such as the hemoglobin glycation index (HGI), stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR), and glycemic variability (GV) offer advanced insights into glucose metabolism. However, their prognostic implications for short- and long-term outcomes post-TAVR remain underexplored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 3342 ICU-admitted TAVR patients via the MIMIC-IV database. Patients were stratified into tertiles for HGI, SHR, and GV levels. Survival analyses, including Kaplan‒Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines (RCSs), were used to assess associations between glycemic control metrics and 30-day and 365-day all-cause mortality in these patients. Sensitivity analyses, subgroup assessments, and external validation were also performed to verify the study findings. RESULTS: During follow-up, 1.6% and 6.9% of patients experienced 30-day and 365-day mortality after TAVR, respectively. In the fully adjusted cox regression model, lower HGI (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.05-2.09, P = 0.025) and higher SHR (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15-2.32, P = 0.006) were most significantly associated with an increased risk of 365-day mortality. Higher SHR was also significantly associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality in patients (HR 2.92, 95% CI 1.32-6.45, P = 0.008). Both lower (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38-0.92, P = 0.019) and higher GV levels (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.06-1.93, P = 0.020) were associated with the risk of 365-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill TAVR patients, glycemic control metrics are closely associated with long-term all-cause mortality. The HGI, SHR, and GV provide prognostic insights into clinical outcomes that surpass conventional glucose measurements. These findings highlight the importance of personalized glycemic management strategies in improving TAVR patient outcomes. 	Cardiovascular diabetology	22/03/2025
10.1002/advs.202413209	Targeting COPA to Enhance Erdafitinib Sensitivity in FGFR-Altered Bladder Cancer.	Zhao H, Gao X, Jiang Y, Yu Y, Wang L, Sun J, Wang M, Xiong X, Huang C, Zhang H, Jiang G	Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family aberrations are common in urothelial cancer. The FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erdafitinib has been approved for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer with FGFR2/3 alterations. Despite the initial efficacy of erdafitinib, resistance cannot be avoided. The molecular mechanisms underlying erdafitinib resistance have not been well investigated. Here, genome-wide CRISPR screen is performed and coatomer protein complex subunit α (COPA) is identified as a key target to enhance erdafitinib sensitivity. Functionally, the deficiency of COPA reduces the proliferation of FGFR-altered bladder cancer cells upon erdafitinib treatment. Mechanistically, COPA knockout increases the degradation of leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing (LRPPRC) protein, leading to reduced inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (ID3) mRNA stability in an m6A-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel mechanism of erdafitinib resistance, providing a potential therapeutic target for FGFR-altered bladder cancer.

10.1016/j.jhep.2025.03.008	Effect of albumin treatment duration on response rates and outcomes in patients	Schleicher EM, Karbannek H, Weinmann-Menke J, Galle PR, Stallmach A, Gairing SJ, Zipprich A, Ripoll C, Labenz C	BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Guidelines recommended volume expansion with albumin for 48 hours for patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury (AKI) to correct hypovolemia and rule out prerenal AKI. A recent update in the Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI)-International Club of Ascites (ICA) consensus guidelines suggested shortening this duration to 24 hours, primarily based on expert opinion. This study aimed to evaluate the response rates to albumin treatment after 24 and 48 hours and to compare and assess the prognostic significance of three different definitions of response to albumin therapy. METHODS: Data from 127 prospectively recruited patients with cirrhosis and AKI from two German centers were analyzed. We examined three response definitions after 24 and 48 hours: (1) serum creatinine (SCr) decrease &gt; 0.3 mg/dl, (2) SCr decrease &gt;25 %, and (3) SCr decrease in at least one AKI stage. Follow-up was prolonged until liver transplantation, death or hemodialysis (HD). RESULTS: Overall, 30-54 % of the patients responded to albumin treatment depending on the definition, and response rates were balanced across AKI stages. Notably, a relevant number of patients who responded at 48 hours did not respond within the first 24 hours. Additional response to albumin during the second 24 hours were 38 %, 24 %, and 25 % (definitions 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Response according to definition 3 was associated with a better HD- and transplantation-free survival. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of patients requires 48 hours to respond to albumin treatment. Shortening time of albumin therapy may lead to overtreatment with terlipressin. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: This study provides valuable insights into the optimal duration of albumin treatment for patients with cirrhosis and acute kidney injury (AKI), challenging the recent recommendation of shortening the treatment period with albumin. Furthermore, the optimal definition for response to albumin (reduction of at least one AKI stage) has been assessed. The results of this study are highly clinically relevant since shortening albumin therapy may lead to overtreatment with terlipressin, and evidence to support the choice of the definition of response to albumin was lacking. Clinicians can use these findings to predict treatment outcomes better, avoid fluid overload, and improve patient prognosis while also considering the potential risks of early intervention with terlipressin.

Abbasi AB, Layden J, Gordon W, Gregurick S, DeLew N, Grossman J, Bierman AS, Monarez S, Curtis LH, Viall AH, Rocca M, Rivera DR, Marston H, Mugge A, Smith SR, Bent K, Macrae J, Sheehy A, Wegrzyn RD, Valdez RB, Johnson C, Bush L, Blum J, Cohen MK, Bertagnolli MM, Califf RM, Tripathi M	IMPORTANCE: Health information technology, such as electronic health records (EHRs), has been widely adopted, yet accessing and exchanging data in the fragmented US health care system remains challenging. To unlock the potential of EHR data to improve patient health, public health, and health care, it is essential to streamline the exchange of health data. As leaders across the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), we describe how DHHS has implemented fundamental building blocks to achieve this vision. OBSERVATIONS: Across DHHS, we have implemented 3 foundational building blocks called for by the 2016 21st Century Cures Act to create a unified approach for secure, high-quality, and timely exchange of health data across the health care system. The United States Core Data for Interoperability provides a minimum baseline for data elements that must be available in federally regulated health information technology systems such as certified EHRs. These data elements now must be accessible using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources-a secure, flexible, and open-industry standard for health data exchange. The Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement provides a network to securely exchange health data across the country. The 3 building blocks of United States Core Data for Interoperability, Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, and Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement are now in place thanks to diligent public and private sector work over 2 administrations. Across DHHS, we are working to refine these building blocks and increase their adoption through regulatory authorities, grants, and public-private partnerships. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The technological building blocks described in this article are creating a unified approach to health data exchange for patient access, clinical care, quality improvement, scientific research, public health, and other uses of health data. Collaborations between the public, nonprofit, and private sectors are needed to maximize their potential. By unlocking the potential of health data, these building blocks are the foundation of a 21st-century digital health care system that will improve the experience of patients and clinicians and result in better health outcomes.

10.1038/s41586-025-08873-8	Structures and mechanism of human mitochondrial pyruvate carrier.	Liang J, Shi J, Song A, Lu M, Zhang K, Xu M, Huang G, Lu P, Wu X, Ma D	Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein complex essential for uptake of pyruvate into matrix as the primary carbon source for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle(1,2). Here, we report six cryo-EM structures of human MPC in three different states: three structures obtained at different conditions in intermembrane space (IMS)-open state with highest resolution of 3.2 Å, a structure of pyruvate-treated MPC in occluded state at 3.7 Å, and two structures in matrix-facing state bound with the inhibitor UK5099 or an inhibitory nanobody on the matrix side at 3.2 Å and 3.0 Å, respectively. MPC is assigned into a heterodimer consisting of MPC1 and MPC2, with the transmembrane domain adopting pseudo-C2-symmetry. Approximate rigid body movements occur between the IMS-open state and the occluded state, while structural changes primarily on the matrix side facilitate the transition between the occluded state and the matrix-facing state, revealing the alternating access mechanism during pyruvate transport. In the UK5099-bound structure, the inhibitor fits well and interacts extensively with a pocket that opens to the matrix side. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying MPC-mediated substrate transport, and the recognition and inhibition by UK5099, which will facilitate future drug development targeting MPC.

10.1002/cac2.70021	Immunosuppressive JAG2(+) tumor-associated neutrophils hamper PD-1 blockade	Wang C, Yang M, Zhong Y, Cao K, Wang X, Zhang C, Wang Y, He M, Lu J, Zhang G, Huang Y, Liu H	BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) play a critical role in modulating immune responses and exhibit significant heterogeneity. Our previous study demonstrated that jagged canonical Notch ligand 2 (JAG2)(+) TANs were associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of JAG2(+) TANs in tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment in HGSOC. METHODS: HGSOC samples were collected, with 274 samples constituting two independent cohorts (training and validation cohorts) and an additional 30 samples utilized to establish patient-derived tumor organoids (PDTOs). We characterized the number and phenotype of JAG2(+) TANs by multiplex immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). We investigated the biological functions of JAG2 in immune evasion using in vitro co-culture systems, flow cytometry, tumor-bearing mouse models, and PDTOs. RESULTS: JAG2(+) TANs expressed elevated levels of immunosuppressive molecules, including programmed cell death ligand 1 and CD14, and had independent prognostic value for the overall survival of patients with HGSOC. scRNA-seq analysis revealed that JAG2(+) TANs exhibited a terminally mature phenotype. The infiltration of JAG2(+) TANs was positively correlated with the abundance of effector regulatory T cells (eTregs). Interaction with JAG2(+) TANs skewed CD4(+) T cells towards an eTreg phenotype, a process that was suppressed by the Notch inhibitor LY3039478 and induced by recombinant Jagged2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that JAG2(+) TANs enhanced Notch signaling activation, ultimately promoting recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJ)-induced differentiation of naïve CD4(+) T cells into eTregs. Clinically, JAG2(+) TANs could serve as a biomarker for assessing immunotherapy resistance in various solid tumors. Pharmacological targeting of Notch signaling with LY3039478 or JAG2 neutralization antibodies enhanced the efficacy of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in both xenograft and PDTO models. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of JAG2(+) TANs is crucial for the differentiation of eTregs, which triggers immune evasion and resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Inhibiting Notch signaling with LY3039478 or JAG2 neutralization antibodies may overcome this anti-PD-1 resistance in HGSOC. 	Cancer communications (London, England)	22/03/2025

Here we used an antiviral coiled coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine rich repeat, Barley Stripe Resistance 1 (BSR1), as a model and demonstrate that BSR1 is phosphorylated. Using a proximity labelling approach, we identified a wall-associated kinase-like protein 20 (WAKL20) which negatively regulates BSR1-mediated immune responses by directly phosphorylating the Ser470 residue in the NB-ARC domain of BSR1. Mechanistically, Ser470 phosphorylation results in a steric clash of intramolecular domains of BSR1, thereby compromising BSR1 oligomerization. The phosphorylation site is conserved among multiple plant NLRs and our results show that WAKL20 participates in other NLR-mediated immune responses besides BSR1. Together, our data reveal phosphorylation as a mechanism for modulating plant resistosome assembly, and provide new insight into NLR-mediated plant immunity. 	Nature plants	01/03/2025
10.1111/codi.70046	Alcohol consumption and risk of early onset colorectal cancer: A systematic	Huang S, Yu L, Xiong F, Zhang B, Ruan S	AIM: The existing evidence has shown a positive association between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the evidence is primarily based on studies of CRC in all ages, and the role of alcohol in early onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) remains to be determined. The aim of this study was to investigate an association between the increasing incidence of EOCRC and alcohol consumption. METHOD: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science up to June 2024 for studies that evaluated the association of alcohol intake with EOCRC risk and report specific results (e.g. relative risk, OR or hazard ratio and corresponding 95% CI). Based on the varying designs of the included studies, the corresponding effect values were extracted and categorized into high alcohol consumption and low alcohol consumption groups; a random-effects model was adopted to estimate the pooled effect sizes for analysis. Furthermore, subgroup analyses and publication bias assessments were conducted. RESULTS: Three cohort studies and eight case-control studies were eligible and included. The results were pooled in meta-analyses, which yielded a heightened risk of EOCRC for increased alcohol intake (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.28-1.89, I(2) = 89.3%). In the subgroup analysis, no significant differences were found in the association between alcohol consumption and the risk of developing EOCRC across gender, location or tumour site. The results of sensitivity analysis and publication bias indicated that the conclusion was robust. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides possible evidence for an association between alcohol consumption and risk of EOCRC. More research is needed in the future to confirm these findings.

10.1016/j.lanepe.2024.101183	PFMG2025-integrating genomic medicine into the national healthcare system in		Integrating genomic medicine into healthcare systems is a health policy challenge that requires continuously transferring scientific advances into clinics and ensuring equal access for patients. France was one of the first countries to integrate genome sequencing into clinical practice at a nationwide level, with the ambition to provide more accurate diagnostics and personalized treatments. Since 2016, the French government has invested €239M in the 2025 French Genomic Medicine Initiative (PFMG2025) which has so far focused on patients with rare diseases (RD), cancer genetic predisposition (CGP) and cancers. PFMG2025 has addressed numerous challenges to set up an operational organizational framework. As of December the 31st 2023, 12,737 results were returned to prescribers for RD/CGP patients (median delivery time: 202 days, diagnostic yield: 30.6%) and 3109 for cancer patients (median delivery time: 45 days). PFMG2025&#x27;s future priorities encompass ensuring economic sustainability, strengthening links with research, empowering patients and practitioners, and fostering collaborations with European partners. FUNDING: As of December the 31st 2023, €239M have been invested by the French government. 	The Lancet regional health. Europe	01/03/2025
10.1016/S2215-0366(25)00028-8	Clinical and cost-effectiveness of lithium versus quetiapine augmentation for	Cleare AJ, Kerr-Gaffney J, Goldsmith K, Zenasni Z, Yaziji N, Jin H, Colasanti A, Geddes JR, Kessler D, McAllister-Williams RH, Young AH, Barrera A, Marwood L, Taylor RW, Tee H	BACKGROUND: Lithium and quetiapine are first-line augmentation options for treatment-resistant depression; however, few studies have compared them directly, and none for longer than 8 weeks. We aimed to assess whether quetiapine augmentation therapy is more clinically effective and cost-effective than lithium for patients with treatment-resistant depression over 12 months. METHODS: We did this pragmatic, open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled superiority trial at six National Health Service trusts in England. Eligible participants were adults (aged ≥18 years) with a current episode of major depressive disorder meeting DSM-5 criteria, with a score of 14 or higher on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at screening who had responded inadequately to two or more therapeutic antidepressant trials. Exclusion criteria included having a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or current psychosis. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to the decision to prescribe lithium or quetiapine, stratified by site, depression severity, and treatment resistance, using block randomisation with randomly varying block sizes. After randomisation, pre-prescribing safety checks were undertaken as per standard care before proceeding to trial medication initiation. The coprimary outcomes were depressive symptom severity over 12 months, measured weekly using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, and time to all-cause treatment discontinuation. Economic analyses compared the cost-effectiveness of the two treatments from both an NHS and personal social services perspective, and a societal perspective. Primary analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned participants. People with lived experience were involved in the trial. The trial is completed and registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial registry, ISRCTN16387615. FINDINGS: Between Dec 5, 2016, and July 26, 2021, 212 participants (97 [46%] male gender and 115 [54%] female gender) were randomly assigned to the decision to prescribe quetiapine (n=107) or lithium (n=105). The mean age of participants was 42·4 years (SD 14·0 years) and 188 (89%) of 212 participants were White, seven (3%) were of mixed ethnicity, nine (4%) participants were Asian, four (2%) were Black, three (1%) were of Other ethnicity, and ethnicity was not recorded for one (1%) participant. Participants in the quetiapine group had a significantly lower overall burden of depressive symptom severity than participants in the lithium group (area under the between-group differences curve -68·36 [95% CI -129·95 to -6·76; p=0·0296). Time to discontinuation did not significantly differ between the two groups. Quetiapine was more cost-effective than lithium. 32 serious adverse events were recorded in 18 participants, one of which was deemed possibly related to the trial medication in a female participant in the lithium group. The most common serious adverse event was overdose, occurring in three (3%) of 107 participants in the quetiapine group (seven events) and three (3%) of 105 participants in the lithium group (five events). INTERPRETATION: Results of the trial suggest that quetiapine is more clinically effective than lithium as a first-line augmentation option for reducing symptoms of depression in the long-term management of treatment-resistant depression, and is probably more cost-effective than lithium.

10.1097/HEP.0000000000001313	Higher level of Hepatitis B Surface antigen associated with delayed development	Tseng TC, Hosaka T, Pan MH, Liu CJ, Suzuki F, Chen CJ, Su TH, Kumada H, Yang WT, Yang HC, Liu CH, Chen PJ, Yang HI, Kao JH	BACKGROUND: Active viral replication in patients with chronic HBV infection is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the HCC risk in highly viremic patients, such as immune-tolerant patients, remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between viral factors and HCC risk in patients with chronic HBV infection, focusing on immune-tolerant patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 6,139 non-cirrhotic Taiwanese patients with chronic HBV infection were enrolled, comprising 2,666 patients from ERADICATE-B study and 3,473 patients from REVEAL-HBV study. The primary endpoint was HCC development. The relationships between viral factors and HCC risk in HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Over a median 21.7-year follow-up, 547 patients developed HCC. The relationship between viral factors and HCC risk varied depending on HBeAg status. HCC risk increased with viral load and plateaued at ≥5 log10 IU/mL in HBeAg-negative patients, while showing limited correlation in HBeAg-positive patients. Conversely, HBsAg levels were positively associated with HCC risk in HBeAg-negative patients but negatively associated in HBeAg-positive patients. Further investigation focusing on HBeAg-positive immune-tolerant patients showed that HBsAg levels ≥10,000 IU/mL (vs. &lt;10,000 IU/mL) were associated with delayed HCC development, which was validated both internally through various subgroup analyses and externally by an independent Japanese cohort. CONCLUSION: Predictive roles of HBV DNA and HBsAg levels in HCC development differ between HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive patients. Particularly, among immune-tolerant patients, HBsAg levels ≥10,000 IU/mL showed delayed development of HCC, suggesting HBsAg as a biomarker to define genuine immune-tolerant patients.

10.1093/bjs/znaf057	Impact of PD1 blockade added to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on rectal cancer	Pang K, Liu X, Yao H, Lin G, Kong Y, Li A, Han J, Wu G, Wang X, Ye Y, Zhang J, Chen G, Wu A, Xiao Y, Yang Y, Zhang Z	BACKGROUND: The addition of PD1 blockade to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been shown to significantly increase pCR rates in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Yet, its impact on total mesorectal excision (TME) remains unknown. METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of the randomized POLARSTAR trial, which enrolled patients with LARC at eight major colorectal cancer centres in Beijing to compare neoadjuvant CRT plus PD1 blockade with CRT alone, was undertaken. Patients received one of three combinations of neoadjuvant treatments before TME surgery: CRT plus concurrent PD1 blockade (concurrent group), CRT plus sequential PD1 blockade (sequential group), and CRT alone (control group). Several parameters related to TME surgery were studied. RESULTS: For the concurrent group, the sequential group, and the control group, 52, 46, and 45 patients respectively were included in this analysis. The proportion of patients undergoing sphincter-saving plus one-stage anastomosis surgery was 92% (48 of 52), 96% (44 of 46), and 87% (39 of 45) respectively. The proportion of patients without a stoma was 21% (11 of 52), 17% (8 of 46), and 11% (5 of 45) respectively. The grade 3/4 surgical complication rate was 4% (2 of 52), 7% (3 of 46), and 4% (2 of 45) respectively. Significant differences were observed between the sequential group and the control group with respect to the proportion of patients with TRG0 (37% versus 18% respectively; P = 0.040), ypT0/is ypN0 (39% versus 20% respectively; P = 0.046), and a low neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score (54% versus 31% respectively; P = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant CRT plus PD1 blockade enhances pathological tumour regression and is beneficial to the successful implementation of TME in patients with LARC. Validations with larger sample sizes are warranted. 	The British journal of surgery	04/03/2025
10.1038/s41586-025-08728-2	Regulated somatic hypermutation enhances antibody affinity maturation.	Merkenschlager J, Pyo AGT, Silva Santos GS, Schaefer-Babajew D, Cipolla M, Hartweger H, Gitlin AD, Wingreen NS, Nussenzweig MC	Germinal centres are specialized microenvironments where B cells undergo affinity maturation. B cells expressing antibodies whose affinity is improved by somatic hypermutation are selected for expansion by limiting numbers of T follicular helper cells. Cell division is accompanied by mutation of the immunoglobulin genes, at what is believed to be a fixed rate of around 1 × 10(-3) per base pair per cell division(1). As mutagenesis is random, the probability of acquiring deleterious mutations outweighs the probability of acquiring affinity-enhancing mutations. This effect might be heightened, and even become counterproductive, in B cells that express high-affinity antibodies and undergo the greatest number of cell divisions(2). Here we experimentally examine a theoretical model that explains how affinity maturation could be optimized by varying the rate of somatic hypermutation such that cells that express higher-affinity antibodies divide more but mutate less per division. Data obtained from mice immunized with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or a model antigen align with the theoretical model and show that cells producing high-affinity antibodies shorten the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle and reduce their mutation rates. We propose that these mechanisms safeguard high-affinity B cell lineages and enhance the outcomes of antibody affinity maturation. 	Nature	19/03/2025
10.1016/j.ahj.2025.03.013	Hyperoxemic Oxygen Therapy in Patients with Acute Anterior Myocardial Infarction:	Zeymer U, Hassinger F, Bramlage P, Schäfer A, Westermann D, Thiele H	BACKGROUND: Patients with acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are at high risk for death and heart failure (HF) despite treatment with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Adjunctive therapy with hyperoxemic supersaturated oxygen (SSO2) following PCI reduced infarct size in previous randomized trials, but none of these trials were powered for clinical endpoints. AIMS: The HOT-AAMI trial evaluates whether hyperoxemic supersaturated oxygen (SSO2) therapy following PCI reduces the risk of death and heart failure. METHODS: HOT-AAMI is a multicenter, 1:1 randomized, open-label study across 50 sites in Germany. Patients presenting with anterior STEMI and undergoing successful PCI of the left anterior descending artery are randomized to receive SSO2 therapy on top of standard care or standard of care alone. The primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause mortality or unplanned heart failure hospital admission or outpatient visit due to heart failure requiring intravenous diuretic therapy during 12-48 months follow-up. Secondary endpoints include cardiovascular mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, and quality of life. The sample size calculation for the HOT-AAMI trial is based on detecting a relative reduction of 25% in the primary composite endpoint. In the control group, a yearly event rate of 16% is expected, comprised of mortality (7%), hospitalization for heart failure (5%), and acute heart failure requiring outpatient treatment (4%). The study is designed to detect this 25 % relative difference with a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and 80% power, requiring a total of 393 events; therefore 1266 patients will be enrolled. CONCLUSIONS: The HOT-AAMI trial is the first trial powered to determine whether SSO2 therapy, administered immediately post-PCI, improves death and heart failure outcomes in patients with anterior STEMI.

This study aimed to describe the use of ICS in patients with bronchiectasis across Europe. METHODS: Patients with bronchiectasis were enrolled into the European Bronchiectasis Registry from 2015 to 2022. Patients were grouped into ICS users and non-users at baseline and clinical characteristics associated with ICS use were investigated. Patients were followed up for clinical outcomes of exacerbation, hospitalisation and mortality for up to 5 years. We evaluated if elevated blood eosinophil counts (above the laboratory upper limit of normal) modified the effect of ICS on exacerbations. RESULTS: 19 324 patients were included for analysis and 10 109 (52.3%) were recorded as being prescribed ICS at baseline. After exclusion of patients with a history of asthma, COPD and/or ABPA, 3174/9715 (32.7%) patients with bronchiectasis were prescribed ICS. Frequency of ICS use varied across countries, ranging from 17% to 85% of included patients. ICS users had more severe disease, with significantly worse lung function, higher Bronchiectasis Severity Index scores and more frequent exacerbations at baseline (p&lt;0.0001). Overall, ICS users did not have a reduced risk of exacerbation or hospitalisation during follow-up, but a significant reduction in exacerbation frequency was observed in the subgroup of ICS users with elevated blood eosinophil counts (relative risk 0.70, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.84, p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: ICS use is common in bronchiectasis, including in those not currently recommended ICS according to bronchiectasis guidelines. ICS use may be associated with reduced exacerbation frequency in patients with elevated blood eosinophils. 	Thorax	23/03/2025

These structures protect the phage from nucleases and may create selective pressure for immunity mechanisms targeting this specific phage family. Here, we identify &quot;jumbo phage killer&quot; (Juk), a two-component immune system that terminates infection of ϕKZ-like phages, suppressing the expression of early phage genes and preventing phage DNA replication and phage nucleus assembly while saving the cell. JukA (formerly YaaW) rapidly senses the EPI vesicle by binding to an early-expressed phage protein, gp241, and then directly recruits JukB. The JukB effector structurally resembles a pore-forming toxin and destabilizes the EPI vesicle. Functional anti-ϕKZ JukA homologs are found across bacterial phyla, associated with diverse effectors. These findings reveal a widespread defense system that specifically targets early events executed by ϕKZ-like jumbo phages prior to phage nucleus assembly. 	Cell	18/03/2025
10.1099/ijsem.0.002654	Stackebrandtia soli sp. nov., a novel actinobacterium isolated from a soil	Liu MJ, Jin CZ, Park DJ, Asem MD, Xiao M, Salam N, Li WJ, Kim CJ	An aerobic actinobacterium, strain AN130378(T), was isolated from a soil sample collected in Korea and subjected to taxonomic investigation using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data showed that strain AN130378(T) is a member of the genus Stackebrandtia, with sequence similarities of 97.3 % to Stackebrandtia albiflava YIM 45751(T) and 97.1 % to Stackebrandtia endophytica YIM 64602(T). The whole-cell hydrolysates contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, and galactose, glucose and xylose. The major menaquinones were MK-11(H4), MK-10(H4) and MK-11(H6), while the major fatty acids were identified as iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C17 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C17 : 0 and summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c). The polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine, an unidentified aminophospholipid, four unidentified glycolipids, three unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified polar lipids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was determined to be 67.7 mol%. All chemotaxonomic and genotypic data indicated that the strain belongs to the genus Stackebrandtia. On the basis of morphological, chemotaxonomic data and phylogenetic analysis, strain AN130378(T) is considered to represent a novel species within the genus Stackebrandtia, for which the name Stackebrandtia soli sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AN130378(T) (=DSM 103573(T)=KCTC 39809(T)). 	International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology	01/04/2018

Oncogene addiction to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a hallmark of HNSCC, but the clinical efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapies remains low. Understanding molecular networks governing EGFR-driven progression is paramount to the exploration of (co)-treatment targets and predictive markers. METHODS: We performed function-based mapping of differentially expressed genes in EGFR-mediated local invasion (fDEGs) using photoconvertible tracers and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in a cellular 3D-model. RESULTS: Upon alignment with public single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets and HNSCC-specific regulons, a gene regulatory network of local invasion (invGRN) was inferred from gene expression data, which was overrepresented in budding tumors. InvGRN comprises the central hubs inhibin subunit beta alpha (INHBA) and snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2), and druggable fDEGs integrin subunit beta 4 (ITGB4), laminin 5 (LAMB3/LAMC2), and sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1). Blockade of INHBA repressed local invasion and was reverted by activin A, laminin 5, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, demonstrating a functional interconnectivity of the invGRN. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of malignant cells and the invGRN are induced by newly defined EGFR-activity subtypes with prognostic value that are promoted by amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG). Importantly, co-inhibition of SPHK1 showed synthetic effects on Cetuximab-mediated invasion blockade and high expression of selected fDEGs was associated with response to Cetuximab in patient-derived xenotransplantation (PDX) and R/M-HNSCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: We describe an actionable network of EGFR-mediated local invasion and define druggable effectors with predictive potential regarding the response of R/M-HNSCC to Cetuximab.

10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.100	Association between RAR and the prevalence and prognosis of depression: A	Zhu XF, Hu YQ, Long ZW, Cao MZ	BACKGROUND: Depression has become a significant public health issue. The red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) is regarded as a reliable marker of inflammation and nutritional status, yet the association between them remains unknown. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the association between RAR and depression. METHODS: 28,737 participants were included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005-2018. The weighted multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression explored the relationship between RAR and the prevalence and mortality of depression. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) detected nonlinear relationships and threshold effects. The stratified analysis explored potential interaction variables. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, 2519 participants (7.67 %) had depression. Weighted multivariate logistic regression showed RAR was independently associated depression (OR = 1.26, 95 % CI = 1.12, 1.42, P &lt; 0.001). In the cohort study, there were 301 cases of all-cause mortality (9.94 %) in depression population, including 77 cases of cardiovascular mortality (2.66 %). Weighted multivariate Cox regression analysis presented that RAR was related to higher all-cause mortality (HR = 1.98, 95 % CI = 1.62, 2.42, P &lt; 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 1.73, 95 % CI = 1.19, 2.51, P = 0.004) in the depression population. Subgroup analysis showed that RAR was consistently related to the prevalence and mortality of depression across all subgroups (all P &lt; 0.05). RCS revealed that the relationship between RAR and depression was nonlinear (P for nonlinear = 0.011), while the association between RAR and all-cause mortality was linear (P for nonlinear = 0.245). CONCLUSIONS: RAR is significantly associated with the prevalence and prognosis of depression. Nevertheless, more investigation is required to elucidate the underlying processes.

However, the mechanism underlying this inhibition is not fully understood. Here, we report that the multiple organellar RNA-editing factor 8 (MORF8) forms condensates with solid-like properties in chloroplasts upon heat stress. In vitro data show that the MORF8 condensation is intrinsically heat-dependent and primarily determined by its IDR (intrinsically disordered region). Purification and characterization of MORF8 condensates show that numerous editing factors including PPR proteins and MORFs are partitioned. We provide both genetic and biochemical evidence that MORF8 condensation inhibits chloroplast RNA editing. In agreement, we find that both heat stress and MORF8 condensation lead to reduced editing of RNAs encoding NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex and impaired NDH activity and photosynthesis efficiency. These findings uncover MORF8 as a putative chloroplastic thermosensor that mediates photosynthesis inhibition by heat and highlight the functional significance of solid material properties of biomolecular condensates.

10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.1421	Seven vs Fourteen Days of Antibiotics for Gram-Negative Bloodstream Infection: A	Lee TC, Prosty CJ, Fralick M, Huttner A, McDonald EG, Molina J, Paul M, Pinto R, Rishu A, von Dach E, Yahav D, Fowler R, Daneman N	IMPORTANCE: Gram-negative bloodstream infections are a common cause of hospitalization. A 2-week duration of antibiotic therapy has been commonly used, but shorter durations may have similar outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether 7 days of antibiotic therapy was noninferior to 14 days. DATA SOURCES: Starting with a 2022 individual patient data meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched to identify additional eligible randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted from May 1, 2022, until November 30, 2024. STUDY SELECTION: RCTs involving primarily adults who were hospitalized at the time of Gram-negative bloodstream infection and were allocated to 7 or 14 days of antibiotic therapy. Studies were independently reviewed by 2 investigators. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: PRISMA guidelines were followed. Data were extracted by 2 investigators. Any unpublished data were obtained directly from study authors. Risk of bias and certainty of the evidence were assessed in duplicate using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, version 2, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Data were pooled by separate random-effects meta-analyses for the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations. A noninformative prior probability was used for the effect, and an evidence-based weakly informative prior probability was used for heterogeneity. Risk ratios (RRs), 95% credible intervals (CrIs), and probability of noninferiority were calculated using a prespecified upper bound of 1.25 or less. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ninety-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Four eligible RCTs contributed 3729 patients in the ITT population (1912 women [51.3%]; median age range, 67-79 years) and 3126 in the PP population. In the ITT analysis, within 90 days, 226 patients (12.8%) receiving 7 days of antibiotics died compared with 253 (13.7%) receiving 14 days, corresponding to an RR for 90-day mortality of 0.91 (95% CrI, 0.69-1.22) and a 97.8% probability of noninferiority. In the PP analysis, the RR was 0.93 (95% CrI, 0.68-1.32), corresponding to a 95.1% probability of noninferiority. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of patients with Gram-negative bloodstream infections and adequate source control, 7 days of antibiotic therapy had a high probability of being noninferior to 14 days. These findings support a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy for appropriately selected patients like those in the included RCTs. 	JAMA network open	03/03/2025
